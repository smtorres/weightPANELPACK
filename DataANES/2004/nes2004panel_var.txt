---------
Error flag for the diplomacy/military force scales.

VALID CODES:

2. After probe correction

NOTE:
-----
During the field period, for the diplomacy /military force 
scales Q144-Q147 an error was discovered in the probe , 
text, which had appeared as follows prior to the discovery:
   (As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with

   diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the U.S.
   must be ready to use international force, and of
   course you can choose points 2,3,4,5, or 6 in between.)
instead of [correct version]:
   (As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with
   diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the U.S.
   must be ready to use military force, and of course
   you can choose points 2,3,4,5, or 6 in between.)
This error was corrected immediately upon discovery but 
only after approximately half of the interviews were
already completed. Since the probe as it appeared onscreen
was specifically flagged as optional text, it is unknown 
precisely when the incorrect version was actually read 
aloud prior to the error discovery.  However, PostErr.1 
identifies cases that were administered prior to the date
when the instrument was revised.
Cases are coded 1 if the respondent was asked the
diplomacy/force interventionism series before the probe fix 
was implemented, indicating that the question may have 
been administered with the incorrect probe text read to 
the respondent.  Cases coded 2 were administered with
the correct probe text appearing onscreen.

NOTE:

House incumbents have been regarded as candidates (already)
in office and representing a district -- where district is
regarded as a geographic unit-- at the time of the 2004
election.  The extent of the Texas redistricting prior to
the 2004 election produced House races with incumbents
running in areas where he or she had provided little or no
prior representation, thus no Texas candidate has been
identified as a true incumbent for the new Texas districts
in effect for the 2004 election (House type race 44-49).
In Louisiana (House type race 91-94), the runoff system allows
multiple candidates from a single party to run in the November
general election.

========================================================================

I'd like to get your feelings toward some people in
the news these days. I'll read the name of a person and
I'll ask you to rate that person on a thermometer that
runs from 0 to 100 degrees. Rating above 50 means that

you feel favorable and warm toward the person. Rating
below 50 means that you feel unfavorable and cool toward
the person. Rating right at the 50 degree mark means you
don't feel particularly warm or cold. You may use any
number from 0 to 100 to tell me how favorable or
unfavorable your feelings are. If we come to a person
whose name you don't recognize, just tell me and we'll
move on to the next one.

            F1H6. INTRODUCTION - DIPLOMACY OR MILITARY FORCE SCALE
========================================================================

Some people believe the United States should
solve international problems by using diplomacy
and other forms of international pressure and use
military force only if absolutely necessary.
Suppose we put such people on a scale that goes
from 1 to 7, placing them at the end of the scale
numbered "1".
Other people believe that diplomacy and pressure
often fail and the US must be ready to use military
force. Suppose these people are at the other end of
the scale, at point number "7". And of course other
people fall into positions in-between, at points
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

========================================================================
P045104     Q144.f1h6a. Diplomacy/Military Force Scale
========================================================================

POST-ELECTION SURVEY:

QUESTION:
---------
Where would you place YOURSELF on this scale, or
haven't you thought much about this?
(As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with
diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the
U.S. must be ready to use military force, and of
course you can choose points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
in between.)

VALID CODES:
------------
1. U.S. should solve with diplomacy and international pressure
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7. U.S. must be ready to use military force

MISSING CODES:
--------------
0. Haven't thought much about this
8. Don't know
9. Refused

NOTES:
-----
See PostErr.1.
During the field period, an error was discovered
in the probe, which had appeared as follows prior to the
discovery:
   (As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with
   diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the U.S.
   must be ready to use international force, and of
   course you can choose points 2,3,4,5, or 6 in between.)
This error was corrected during the field period but 
only after approximately half of the interviews were
already completed. Since the probe as it appeared onscreen
was specifically flagged as optional text, it is unknown 
precisely when the incorrect version was actually 
used prior to the error discovery.  However, interviews 
are identified in [Post-election administration item]
PostErr.1 if they were administered prior to the date
when the instrument was revised to display the correct
probe text.

            F2K7. INTRODUCTION - GOVERNMENT SERVICES SCALE
========================================================================

Some people think the government should provide
fewer services even in areas such as health and
education in order to reduce spending.
Suppose we put such people on a scale that goes
from 1 to 7, placing them at the end of the scale
numbered "1". Other people feel it is important
for the government to provide many more services
even if it means an increase in spending. Suppose
these people are at the other end of the scale,
at point number "7". And, of course other people
have opinions somewhere in between, at points
2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
