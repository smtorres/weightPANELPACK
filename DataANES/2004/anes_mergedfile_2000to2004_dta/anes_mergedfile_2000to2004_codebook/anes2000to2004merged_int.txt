>> ANES 2000-2004 Merged File General Introduction

The ANES 2000-2004 Merged file includes data for 1,807 cases.
Respondents were first interviewed in the ANES 2000 Time Series Study (the 
number of cases included in the ANES 2000-2004 Merged File correspond to the 
set of respondents in the ANES 2000 Time Series Study data release). Of these 
initial 1,807 respondents, 1,187 were re-interviewed in the ANES 2002 Time
Series Study (which also interviewed 'fresh cross' cases that are not included
in this file).  In 2004, 840 of the 1,187 respondents who had been interviewed 
in both 2000 and 2002 were re-interviewed in the ANES 2004 Panel Study (please 
note that the ANES 2004 Panel Study is different from the ANES 2004 Time Series
Study).  Respondent participation, by wave, is documented in Table A, 
below.

This data file does not represent new content, but is a derivative file,
that is, the result of merging data from the ANES 2000 Time Series Study, the 
ANEs 2002 Time Series Study, and the ANES 2004 Panel Study, all of 
which were previously released separately.

In this file, all study-specific variables and documentation are included.  
The ID  variables appear at the beginning of the file. The ANES 2000 Time Series
Study Post ID, has been dropped, and the variable fromthe ANES 2004 Panel Study
P041001 (participation by wave) has been replaced by a more complete participation 
variable.  The codebook appendix file contains appendices from the ANES 2000
Time Series Study codebook, the ANES 2002 Time Series codebook, and the ANES
2004 Panel Study codebook, including master codes, together with the three 
codebook introductions.

There are five weight variables included (labeled by year and wave,
as appropriate).


TABLE A:  2000-2002-2004 Respondent Participation By Wave
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The table below displays respondents' participation by wave.  Columns
represent the five surveys; rows correspond to participation possibilities.  
For example, the first row indicates that 152 respondents in this file 
were interviewed in the ANES 2000 Time Series Pre-Election survey and never 
interviewed again.  The tenth/last row indicates that 748 respondents 
were interviewed in all five waves.

The columns total to the sample size in each survey.  [Please note:  In
the ANES 2002 Time Series Study, a fresh cross-section of respondents was sampled 
in addition to the 'panel' sample.  The fresh cross-section sample is not included 
in the data for this file; thus Ns for the fresh cross-section sample are
shown at the bottom in column totals for the ANES 2002 Time Series Study only.]

>> ANES 2000-2004 Merged File Use with Contextual Variables

The ANES 2000-2004 Merged File may be merged with the ancillary
contextual file that is available as part of the ANES 2002 Time Series Study
release. The ANES 2002 Time Series Study Contextual File contains candidate 
information specific to the districts represented in the ANES 2002 Time
Series Study.

The ANES 2000-2004 Merged File may also be merged with the contextual
file available as part of the ANES 2004 Time Series Study release.  The ANES
2004 Time Series Study Contextual File contains 2004 candidate and other 
information for all 435 U.S. House districts (and Washington D.C.).


>> ANES 2000-2004 Merged File Note on Confidential Materials

Beginning with the 1986 Election Study, ANES has released occupation code
variables in less detail than preceding years.  The full release of
this dataset includes collapsed occupation coding.  Those who need the full
occupation code for their research should contact the ANES project staff for
information about the conditions under which access may be provided.

The Amrican National Election Studies have also not included information for
census tracts or minor civil divisions since 1978, and since 2000 county
and PSU identification have no longer been made available. Permission to use
detailed geographic information for scholarly research may be obtained from
the Board of Overseers.  More information about this is available from ANES
project staff.

Note that coding of the full religious denomination variable is in some
cases based on alphabetic "other, please specify" variables, which are
restricted for reasons of confidentiality, although access may be provided
to legitimate scholars under established ANES procedures.

Finally, the American National Election Studies have traditionally contained 
several minutes of open-ended responses (for example, the candidate likes 
and dislikes).  These questions are coded according to master code schemes.  
Other scholars have developed alternative or supplemental coding schemes 
for such questions.  The Board of Overseers wishes to encourage these 
efforts but in ways which respect our obligation to protect the privacy 
and anonymity of respondents.  Circumstances under which individuals may 
have access to transcribed versions of these questions have been worked out 
and those interested should contact the ANES project staff for further 
details.


>> ANES 2000-2004 Merged File Structure and Processing information

The data file for the ANES 2000-2004 Merged File is constructed
with a single logical record for each respondent. Records are in comma-
delimited ASCII format with variable names comprising the first data line.

The data collection was processed according to standard processing
procedures.  The data were checked for inconsistent code values which,
when found, were corrected or recoded to missing data values. Consistency
checks were performed.  Annotation was added by the processors for
explanatory purposes.

..........................................................................
NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE DOES NOT REPRESENT AN ACTUAL ANES VARIABLE

LINE 02
Contains identifiers, including (left to right) the variable name, the
question "tag" or item number (Q9a), and the variable label.  Since the
variable label begins with the question tag, the question tag only appears
once, as part of the variable label.

LINES 05-08
This describes who is being asked the question, inverse to the INAP
conditions (lines 34-35).  Each line ending with ":" describes one condition
that has been met to reach this question.
"/" at the end of a line is equivalent to an "OR" between the condition
preceding and the condition following the "/".  In this example, respondents
who were asked this question were respondents who 1) said they voted, and
who 2) said they voted specifically for President, and who 3) voted for a
major party Presidential candidate OR for another party's candidate.  Note
that a corresponding "/" sometimes appears in the question text when
question wording varies according to which of the OR conditions applies. See
lines 12-17.

LINES 12-17
Several conventions are observed in codebook presentation of question text.
1) Text bracketed between ">" and "<" (line 12, line 15) indicates that
   case-specific text was loaded onto the instrument by the survey
   application.
   In this example, ">NAME OF MAJOR PARTY<" indicates that either
   "Democratic" or "Republican" was loaded into the question text,
   depending up which major party candidate R indicated he had voted for
   earlier in the questionnaire
2) Text bracketed between "[" and "]" (lines 12-14; line 15) displays
   text options, separated by "/".  In this example, the first option is for
   Rs who had voted for a major party candidate; the first 2 sentences read
   to these respondent are:
  "You've indicated that you voted for the >NAME OF MAJOR PARTY<
   Presidential candidate in 2004. How well has the >NAME OF MAJOR PARTY<
   party performed over the past four years?"
   On the other hand, in this example, if R voted for another party's
   candidate, the first 2 sentences are:
  "You've indicated that you voted for the >NAME OF OTHER PARTY< party in
   2004. How well has that party performed over the past four years?"
3) Text in parentheses (line 17) is read at the interviewer's discretion.
4) Text in CAPS, other than text bracketed with ">" "<" per 1), indicates
   words or phrases that appeared underlined in the instrument for emphasis.
   In this example (lines 16-17), the words "very good", "good", "bad", and
   "very bad" had appeared underlined for interviewer emphasis..

LINE 21
With few exceptions, interviewer instructions appear in the instrument
immediately following the question text.

LINES 34-35
INAP describes the specific paths of all respondents whom the instrument
skips over the question.  Each condition which results in a skip is listed,
separated by ";".
