PSU (Primary Selection Unit)

An abbreviated version of the Census MSA of which it is part for SR MSAs 
and Non-SR MSAs.  For non-MSAs the PSU Name is the name of the county
involved.  If there is more than one county in the non MSA (non MSA counties
were linked to reach a minimum measure of size of 5000 Households) it is named
for the county with the most Households in 1990.

The hundreds place of the Primary Selection Unit (PSU) for Cross Section
Segments that are all from the 1990 National Sample indicates when the segment
is in a Self Representing (SR) Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a Non Self
Representing (Non SR) MSA or a Non MSA as designated by the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget.

100's are SR MSA areas
200's are Non SR MSA areas* 
300's are Non MSA areas**
400's are Non MSA PSU's from the 1980 National Sample Design

* PSU 434 is a Non Self Representing MSA from the 1980 National Sample Design.
**For ANES 2000 all Non MSA PSU's are Non MSA's from the 1980 National Sample
Design. 

The tens place of the PSU for the 1990 National Sample indicate which Census
Division the segment is located in.  The variable Census Region (described on
page two) indicates the Census Region for each of the divisions mentioned
below.
 
       Division                  Region (Census Region)
       ------------------        ---------------------
10     New England               North East (1)
20     Middle Atlantic           North East (1)

The ones place of the PSU are simply sequential numbers within the division.


SEGMENT NAME

The name of the city or Census Place or Census MCD with the most housing 
units (HUs) within the area segment boundary.


BELT CODE

Code 1 includes all except two of the 28 1990 National Sample
Frame self-representing areas.  Central Cities of Denver,
Co MSA and Kansas City MSA are NOT to be coded 1.  Central
Cities of all other self-representing areas of the 1990
National Sample Frame are coded 1 (including Nassau-
Suffolk NY and Newark NJ as part of the NYC, NY-Northern
NJ CMSA; Los Angeles, Anaheim, and Riverside CA as part of
the LA-etc. CMSA; and San Francisco and Oakland CA as part
of the SF-Oakland CA CMSA).   For the most part, no 1990
Frame non-self-representing MSA Central Cities  are coded
1, except as noted below.  [NOTE: In 1990, the PSU
definition in New England states is the New England County
Metropolitan Area (NECMA).  This means that for the 1990
Frame segments in New England--there may be Central Cities
of MSAs included in the NECMA definition that are not in
the CMSA/MSA definition.  For example, in Boston MA (1990
frame) the Central Cities include not only those for
Boston MSA but some from other New England MSAs -- some of
which could be outside of the Boston CMSA definition and
could be coded `2'.  It also means that in the Manchester-
Nashua NH  NECMA (non-self-representing) there are two
segment selections in Nashua, NH (central city of Nashua
MA PMSA) which is part of the Boston MA CMSA and has
therefore been coded `1'.]

NECMA/SMSA

The NECMA is the New England County Metropolitan Area code
as described in the 1990 SRC National Sample Design and
Development documentation.
In 1990 the U.S. Census adopted slightly different wording
and abbreviations for metropolitan areas, now known
collectively as Metropolitan Areas (MAs).  What in 1980
were Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs)
became in 1990 either Metropolitan Statistical Areas
(MSAs) or Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas
(PMSAs).   MSA is used for a metropolitan area which
stands alone, i.e., is not a part of a Consolidated
Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA).  PMSA is used for a
metropolitan area which is part of a larger CMSA.

The metropolitan area standards for the 1990's generally
reflect a continuity with those adopted for the 1980's and
maintain the basic concepts originally developed in 1950.
The few substantive changes made between 1980 and 1990 are
detailed in the Federal Register, Vol. 55, No.62 cited in
the footnote.

New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs) provide an
alternative to the official city-and-town based
metropolitan statistical areas in that Census region for
the convenience of data users who desire a county-defined
set of areas.  NECMAs have their separate definition
standards detailed in the Federal Register (p. 12159).
Since the 1990 SRC National Sample primary stage of
selection was based on the NECMA in New England, the 1990
NECMA  is provided in place of 1990 MSA or PMSA for this
variable.


CMSA

The 1990 Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA)
codes are in most cases identical to the 1980 SCSA codes
with the exceptions noted in parenthesis.
In addition to the major changes noted, minor changes in
SCSA and CMSA names have also occurred between 1980 and
1990.
>> 2000 APPENDIX:  CENSUS DEFINITIONS

          THIS NOTE CONTAINS DEFINITIONS OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS
          USED BY THE 1990 U.S. CENSUS OF POPULATION:

               Metropolitan Statistical Areas
               Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas
               Urbanized Areas
               Places
               Incorporated Places
               Unincorporated Places

          1. "METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSA's):"

          The general concept of a metropolitan area is one of a large
          population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that
          have a high degree of economic and social integration with
          that nucleus.

          In 1990 the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and
          the U.S. Census have used the term Metropolitan Statistical
          Area (MSA) for what in 1980 was referred to as Standard
          Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA).  An attempt has been
          made by the study staff to be consistent in using the newer
          terms in the current documentation and definitions.  The
          definitions of characteristics to be classified as a
          metropolitan area have remained fairly consistent--with only
          minor changes between 1980 and 1990.  However, due to
          changes in population size and density, employment,
          commuting and other behavior which defines metropolitan
          areas, the specific geographical composition of any given
          metropolitan area has, of course, frequently changed.  The
          specific MSA title may also have changed as to which cities
          are named and in what order.

          Each MSA has one or more central counties containing the
          area's main population concentration: an urganized area with
          at least 50,000 inhabitants.  An MSA may also include
          outlying counties that have close economic and social
          relationships with the central counties.  The outlying
          counties must have a specified level of commuting to the
          central counties and must also meet certain standards
          regarding metropolitan character, such as population
          density, urban population and population growth.  In New
          England, MSA's are composed of cities and towns rather than
          whole counties.

          The population living in MSA's may also be referred to as
          the metropolitan population.  The population is subdivided
          into "inside central city (or cities)" and "outside central
          city (or cities)."  (The population living outside MSA's
          constitutes the non-metropolitan population.)  Most MSA's
          have one to three CENTRAL CITIES that are named in the
          census title of the MSA.

          2. "CONSOLIDATED METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (CMSA's):"

          In some parts of the country, metropolitan development has
          progressed to the point that adjoining MSA's are themselves
          socially and economically interrelated.  These areas are
          designated consolidated metropolitan statistical areas
          (CMSA's) by the Office of Management and Budget, and are
          defined using standards included as part of the new MSA
          standards described above.  MSA's that are a part of a CMSA
          are referred to as primary metropolitan statistical areas
          (PMSA's).

          Definitions of the six largest CMSA's:

          * In the SRC 1980 National Sample (1992 ANES sample).

          For the purpose of size and distance coding of suburbs and
          non-MSAs, the central cities of the six largest CMSAs are
          listed as:

               1.  New York City (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan,
                   Queens), NY, Elizabeth, NJ and Newark, NJ

               2.  Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pasadena, Pomona, Burbank,
                   Anaheim, Santa Ana, Riverside, San Bernardino and
                   Palm Springs, CA.

               3.  Chicago, Evanston and Chicago Heights, Aurora,
                   Elgin, Joliet, Waukegan and North Chicago, IL

               4.  San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and Livermore, CA

               5.  Philadelphia and Norristown, PA and Camden, NJ

               6.  Detroit, Dearborn, Pontiac and Port Huron, MI

          Both the CMSA definitions and the central city designations
          above are from Metropolitan Statistical Areas, 1990, U.S.
          Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC (Jun 1990)
          (PB90-214420)

          3. "URBANIZED AREAS:"

          The major objective of the Census Bureau in delineating
          urbanized areas is to provide a better separation of urban
          and rural population in the vicinity of large cities.  An
          urbanized area consists of a central city or cities, and
          surrounding closely settled territory ("urban fringe").

          4. "PLACES:"

          Two types of places are recognized in the census
          reports--incorporated places and unincorporated places,
          defined as follows:

          5. "INCORPORATED PLACES:"

          These are political units incorporated as cities, borought,
          towns and villages with the following exceptions: (a)
          boroughs in Alaska; and (b) towns in New York, Wisconsin and
          the New England states.

          6. "UNINCORPORATED PLACES:"

          The Census Bureau has delineated boundaries for closely
          settled population centers without corporate limits.  Each
          place so delineated possesses a definite nucleus of
          residences and has its boundaries drawn to include, if
          feasible, all the surrounding closely settled area.  These
          are called Census Designated Places (CDP's).

>> 2000 APPENDIX: OCCUPATION

The full 3-digit 1990 Census Occupation Code was used to
code the occupation of respondents.  In order to minimize
the amount of highly specific information released about
respondents, the full occupation code has been recoded to a
71 category code, which is based on the occupation code
sub-headings in the Census Code.

Users who need access to the full 3-digit occupation code
for their research purposes should contact ANES project staff
for details about how this could be arranged.

In the code description that follows, the full 1990 Census
Code is presented.  At the beginning of each recoded
section, the statement "(XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE RECODED TO
(ZZ)" indicates the code values to which the specific
occupations have been recoded.  For example, purchasing
managers (009), legislators (003), and funeral directors
(019) have all been recoded to (01).  Numbers in parentheses
following the occupation categories are the U.S. Department
of Commerce's 1980 Standard Occupational Classification code
equivalents.  The abbreviation "pt" means "part" and
"N.E.C." means "not elsewhere classified".

>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 2000: PRE- AND POST-ELECTION SURVEYS

During the early spring of 2001 the American National Election Studies staff 
prepared a comprehensive version of the 2000 American National Election 
Study.  The number of cases in this file, 1807, includes all respondents from
the 2000 Pre- and Post-Election surveys.  1881 variables are produced by 
default using the data definition files provided with the raw data for 
creation of SAS and SPSS system files.  

     The codebook contains documentation for variables beginning with 
identification variables which provide the ANES VERSION NUMBER (version number
of the data file), ANES DATASET NUMBER (number of this dataset), and ICPSR
study number. 



>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  2000 STUDY DESCRIPTION FOR THE AMERICAN NATIONAL
ELECTION STUDY

     The 2000 American National Election Study was conducted by the Center for
Political Studies of the Institute for Social Research, under the general
direction of Nancy Burns and Donald R. Kinder.  Ashley Grosse was the Director
of Studies for the American National Election Studies and oversaw the study from 
early planning stages through release of the 2000 data collection.  She was 
assisted by Laurie Pierson, and Chuck Kierpie.  This is the twenty- sixth in a 
series of studies of American national elections produced by the Center for 
Political Studies and the Survey Research Center, and it is the twelfth 
traditional time-series study to be conducted under the auspices of
National Science Foundation Grants (SBR-9317631, SES-9209410, SES-9009379,
SES-8808361, SES-8341310, SES-8207580, SOC77-08885 and SES 9707741) providing 
long-term support for the American National Election Studies.  Since 1978, the 
American National Election Studies have been designed by a national Board of 
Overseers, the members of which meet several times a year to plan content and 
administration of the major study components.  Board members during the planning
of the 2000 National Election Study included Larry Bartels, Chair (Princeton 
University), Nancy Burns, ex officio (University of Michigan), Charles Franklin 
(University of Wisconsin), John Mark Hansen (University of Chicago), Robert 
Huckfeldt, (Indiana University), Donald Kinder, ex officio (University of 
Michigan), Jon A. Krosnick, (Ohio State University), Arthur Lupia (University 
of California, San Diego), Wendy Rahn (University of Minnesota), Virginia 
Sapiro (University of Wisconsin), W. Phillips Shively (University of
Minnesota), Laura Stoker (University of California, Berkeley).  As part of the 
study planning process, a special planning committee was appointed, a pilot 
study conducted, and stimulus letters sent to members of the scholarly 
community soliciting input on study plans.  Board member Robert Huckfeldt 
chaired the Planning Committee for the 2000 National Election Study which 
included from the Board: Larry Bartels (Princeton University), Nancy Burns 
(University of Michigan), Charles Franklin, (University of Wisconsin), 
John Mark Hansen (University of Chicago), Donald Kinder (University of 
Michigan), Jon A. Krosnick (Ohio State University), Arthur Lupia (University 
of California, San Diego), Virginia Sapiro (University of Wisconsin), Laura 
Stoker (University of California, Berkeley), and five other scholars from the 
community, Steven Ansolabehere (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Janet 
Box-Steffensmeier (Ohio State University), Clem Brooks (Indiana University), 
Darren Davis (Michigan State University), and Donald Green (Yale University), 
and Ashley Grosse (ANES Director of Studies).

     Two pilot studies were carried out prior to the 2000 Election Study for
the purpose of developing new instrumentation and the methodological
investigation of concepts previously measured in ANES surveys.  The 1998 Pilot
Study, one of the most innovative pilots to date, was the first pilot to be
fielded during an election season.  The timing allowed ANES to test
instrumentation that is exclusively related to the electoral context.  The
pilot study focused on the three high-profile gubernatorial contests in 
California, Illinois, and Georgia.  Several new measures that were piloted 
include: media usage; social context and communication; need for evaluation;
group mobilization; public mood; tone of campaign; awareness of campaign 
issues; and whether R owns stock.  Also, a significant portion of the 
interview was devoted to the methodological investigation of concepts 
previously measured in ANES surveys.  Among those were: campaign 
participation; media use; feeling thermometers as measures of awareness; 
vote intention; and political knowledge.

     In March of 2000, ANES fielded a Special Topic Pilot Study, funded by the 
Russell Sage Foundation, to develop and refine a series of new measures on 
social trust.  Additionally, new items were tested in the areas of trust in 
elections, civic engagement, need for cognition, and social desirability.  New 
measures were developed for domain specific trust involving neighbors and co-
workers.  Results indicated that these new measures gauge trust reliably, that 
neighborhood and workplace trust are related to but distinct from general
social trust, and they contribute independently to participation in politics. 
These items were included in the 2000 Election Study.

     Data from the 1998 and 2000 ANES pilot studies are available through the
Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (respectively,
ICPSR 2693 and ICPSR 2936).  

     Results from these pilot studies were used by the Planning Committee in 
formulating recommendations to the Board about study content for the 2000 Pre- 
and Post-Election Survey.  Copies of the Pilot Study Reports are available on 
the ANES Website (www.electionstudies.org), or may be obtained by contacting 
the ANES project staff.

>> 2000 STUDY DESIGN, CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION
 
STUDY DESIGN 

     The 2000 National Election Study entailed both a pre-election interview
and a post-election re-interview.  A freshly drawn cross section of the 
electorate was taken to yield 1807 cases.  The 65 minute pre election survey 
went into the field September 5th, nine weeks before election day.  The 65 
minute post election study, unique to the time series in that no president
elect was named for several days, went into the field the day after the
election, November 8th, and remained in the field until December 18th.

     Because of the study's most innovative feature, a carefully designed mode
experiment, the data represent two presidential studies in 2000, side by side. 
The core study preserves our past commitment to probability area sampling and
face to face interviewing: 1006 respondents interviewed prior to the election
and 694 were re-interviewed face to face after the election.  Supporting the
core study, we used the efficiencies of RDD sampling and telephone
interviewing: 801 respondents were interviewed by phone prior to the election
and 862 respondents were interviewed by phone after the election.  As such,
the experiment will define sharply the differences between the two modes and
allow us to learn what a shift to telephone interviewing will mean for the ANES
time-series.  Further details of the administration of the surveys are given
in "Study Administration," below.


STUDY CONTENT

Substantive themes

     The content for the 2000 Election Study reflects its double duty, both as
the traditional presidential election year time-series data collection and as
a mode study.  Substantive themes represented in the 2000 questionnaires
include:

*  interest in the political campaigns; concern about the outcome; and 
   attentiveness to the media's coverage of the campaign      
*  information about politics
*  evaluation of the presidential candidates and placement of presidential 
   candidates on various issue dimensions

Several new concepts addressed in the 2000 study: 

SOCIAL TRUST: Over the last decade, research on social trust has exploded. In
order to allow ANES to contribute to this research effort, we developed a
series of new measures that approach the problem from a new angle. With
supplementary funding from the Russell Sage Foundation, we developed measures
addressed not to the trustworthiness of people in general, but to the
trustworthiness of neighbors and co-workers. Our 2000 Special Topic Pilot
Study showed that the new measures gauge trust reliably, that neighborhood and
workplace trust are related to but distinct from general social trust, and
that they contribute independently to participation in politics. We included
these measures in the ANES 2000 Time Series Study, again, with support from the 
Russell Sage Foundation. Together with an expanded set of questions on 
participation in civic life that are also part of the 2000 study, we expect to 
see a wide range of exciting new investigations on trust and participation. 

VOTER TURNOUT: A particularly vexing problem for ANES has been over-reporting
of voter turnout. Over the years we have sponsored a series of investigations
trying out possible remedies, without much success. But now it seems that we
may have a solution in hand, based on the source monitoring theory of recall.
The notion here is that some people may remember having voted sometime in the
past but confuse the source of that memory, accidentally misassigning it to
the most recent election, when it actually derives from a prior election. We
are therefore implementing a new item, with expanded response categories to
help respondents be more accurate in determining whether they did in fact vote
in November of 2000. 

POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE: The 2000 study also sees a slight change in the way 
political knowledge is measured. In the past, we have encouraged respondents
to say they "don't know" the answer to our information questions, partly to
avoid embarrassment. But research shows that this differentially encourages
"don't know" responses from some people who may actually know the correct
answer but lack the confidence to say so. As a consequence, the standard way
of putting these questions may underestimate levels of knowledge. In the 2000
study we are therefore encouraging respondents to take their best guesses when
answering the political knowledge questions.

SOCIAL NETWORKS: The reality of citizenship is that individuals seldom go it
alone when they engage in political activities.  Preferences, choices, and 
levels of engagement are contingent on the location of individuals within 
particular social settings.  The 2000 study incorporates a social network 
battery.  The battery is based entirely on the perceptions of survey
respondents regarding the characteristics of their identified discussants.

COGNITIVE STYLE: The ANES 2000 Time Series Study includes two brief but 
reliable measures of cognitive style: need for cognition and need to evaluate. 
The first differentiates among people in the care they give to thinking 
through problems; the second differentiates among people in their tendency to 
evaluate objects as good or bad. Both are associated with extensive 
literatures in psychology, which led to their audition in the 1998 ANES Pilot 
Study. Because of their success there in clarifying turnout, knowledge about 
politics, voter decision-making, and more, they were added to the ANES 2000
Time Series Study.

SURVEY MODE: Perhaps the most important single feature of the ANES 2000 Time 
Series Study is a mode experiment, which supplies the ability to compare 
interviews taken in person (as we've taken them for the past fifty years) with 
interviews taken over the phone. This carefully designed mode experiment, 
driven by theoretical and practical interest, allows scholars to test the 
consequences of survey mode on data quality and reliability.  Moreover, it 
allows the community to asses the impact of what such a change in mode would 
mean for the ANES times series.  The 2000 study incorporates numerous experiments 
to look at the effects of mode on: 7 pt. scales and branching, response order, 
don't know filters, and social desirability.

Congressional Ballot Cards and Incumbent Bias

     In 2000, ANES redesigned the Congressional ballot card used in face
to face interviewing in an attempt to combat overreport for incumbents.
The ballot redesign was based on the research of Box-Steffensmeier, 
Jacobson, and Grant, (later published in POQ, 2000).  Moreover, the change
in ballot form was intended to eliminate the measurement error in vote 
report that has concerned numerous scholars (Wright 1993; Gow and 
Eubank 1984; Jacobson and Rivers 1993; and Jackson and Carsey 2001). Based 
on three experiments during the 1996 elections - the Ohio Union Study, the 
National Black Election Study, and the Texas Post Election Study, ANES 
concluded that a modification to the 1982 style ballot was in order.

     The new ballot cards are intended to give respondents two cues in 
recalling their vote - party identification and name of candidate.  Based on
the findings of Box-Steffensmeier et al., party is the predominant cue in the 
revised ballot.  To randomly distribute that cue, each respondent had two 
ballots printed for the interview - one with the Republican listed first, and
one with the Democrat listed first.  Based on a randomly generated number, 
interviewers were instructed via CAPI to show the respondent the gold or the
blue card.  Examples of the redesigned ballot cards are available on the 2000
Election Study Page of the ANES web site at http://www.electionstudies.org

     In another effort to combat incumbent bias, the vote report question 
was placed earlier in the interview than in previous studies to avoid any 
possible contamination from thermometers, which ask R to rate their member 
of Congress.


Features of a CAI questionnaire

     Using the capabilities of computer-assisted interviewing (CAI) in the
ANES 2000 Time Series Study enabled the introduction of several features that 
are not feasible using a paper-and-pencil questionnaire.  The most significant
of these for users of this data are: randomization within batteries or 
sequences of questions; application of half-sampling to some questions; and 
random order of presentation of blocks of questions.  Randomization within 
batteries refers to presenting, in a randomly determined order, a series of 
questions about the same objects (or people).  An example would be the 
questions about the respondent's likes and dislikes of the four main 
Presidential candidates where the names of Gore, Bush, Buchanan, and Nader 
were inserted randomly as the first, second, third or fourth person to be 
asked about in this series.  
Randomization of names/objects in this way avoids ordering effects that might
be obtained if, for example, the candidates were always asked about in the
same order in every series of questions where a parallel question is asked
about each of the three.  Questions where randomization of order within a
series was in force are clearly identified in the codebook.  Randomization
variables, which allow the user to identify the order of presentation, are
provided for all instances of randomized presentation.  A few questions,
primarily open-ended questions, were half-sampled, so that a randomly selected
half of respondents were asked the question.  Finally, an order experiment,
where a sequence of closed-ended questions was asked early in the interview
for a random half of respondents and late in the interview for the other half,
was included as part of the mode comparison experiment described below.  For
both of these features, the relevant codebook entries contain explanatory
notes.  All random selections were programmed into the computer application of
the questionnaire and occurred automatically and independently of other
circumstances of the interview.  CAI eliminates the preparation of a paper 
and pencil version which would previously have been published in the codebook.

     Candidate information (names, gender and candidate codes) were 
"pre-loaded" into the application to be used during the interview.  
The pre-loaded information is included in the released data.  However,
since paper candidate lists are no longer utilized as field materials, 
there is no "Candidate List" appended to this codebook, although the 
term 'Candidate List' continues to be used in the codebook as a reference 
to the candidate information available to the interviewer (CAPI preload).


STUDY ADMINISTRATION: MODE EXPERIMENT

     ANES election studies are traditionally based on personal, face to face 
interviewing rather than telephone interviewing in order to preserve the
quality of sampling and survey response.  Given questions that have been
raised within the research community about the relatively high expense of
face-to-face interviewing compared with the more widely used telephone mode,
the ANES Board of Overseers authorized a series of efforts to investigate
possibilities for maximizing the use of telephone interviewing.  The 1996 and
1998 election studies included smaller mode experiments to test the
consequences of mode on survey quality and reliability.  The design and
administration of the mode experiment in 2000 was guided by the work of a blue
ribbon committee and the commission of two reports (available at
http://www.electionstudies.org) comparing face to face with telephone surveys. 
The issues included sample coverage, non-response, item non-response, social
desirability bias, and satisficing.  Several experiments were designed in the
ANES 2000 Time Series Study to gather more evidence on those effects.  Those 
experiments are labeled in the question tags by the letter "E".


Question wording experiments for mode effects

In assessing possible mode effects, the ANES Board of Overseers along with the
2000 Planning committee implemented a number of experiments to analyze
response order effects, satisficing, and other possible fatigue effects of
phone interviewing.

The experiments, placed almost exclusively in the pre-election survey are: 
G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, H1, H2,H4, H11, H12, L3, L6, M4, P1, and K2 in the
post-election survey.  Question tags identify experimental questions with the
letter "E".  The table below specifies the type of experiment, concept and
question number, and the altered wording.

Telephone wording

     Because the questions asked by ANES over the last fifty years have been 
administered in person, the question text , that we are careful not to alter, 
reflects the context of that traditional face to face interview.  To
understand what such a change in mode would mean to the time series we
implemented the RDD study with a questionnaire that reflected the necessary
changes in mode.  The overlap between those questions is approximately 75%.
Where questions were to be read differently, question tags are identified with
the letter "T".

Pre-election study: administration

     Interviewing for the pre-election survey began on September 5, 2000
and concluded on November 6, 2000.  A total of 1807 interviews were conducted
prior to the election - 1006 face to face and 801 by telephone.  The average
length of interview was 68.1 minutes - 70.5 minutes in face to face interviews
and 65.1 minutes in telephone interviews.  The overall response rate was
61.2% - 64.8 for the face to face interviewing and 57.2 for the telephone 
interviewing.

     In an effort to improve response rates, respondents received a pre-
notification packet by two day mail, which included a brochure on the study,
and a "Monte Blanc" style pen with the University of Michigan seal, and 
a letter notifying them we would be contacting them and would offer them 
payment for their time - 20 dollars.  Toward the end of the study, ANES staff
became concerned that the production goals would not be met by election day.
This concern motivated a number of interventions:  refusal conversion
training for interviewers having difficulty, refusal conversion packets
mailed by two day mail, and interviewer incentives, and increased respondent
incentives.  Interviewers were given ten dollars for every interview
conducted after 10/26/01, and respondent incentives were increased 
from $20 to $40.  To take account of those changes, variable V000139a
identifies those cases where interviewers received an incentive per 
completed case, and variable V00016 identifies those cases where R 
received the increased incentive.

Post-election study: administration

     In an effort to cut rising costs while in the field, two segment areas 
of the face to face sample were randomly selected to receive post interviews
by telephone.  By randomly selecting forty-seven segments for telephone post 
interviews, 200 cases were removed from the strict mode experiment.

     Respondents again received a prenotification letter.  Respondents
were informed that they would receive $20 dollars as payment for their time.
Incentives were not increased for those who had received $40 in the pre-
election.

     Interviewing began on November 8, 2000 and concluded on December 18,
2000.  A total of 1555 interviews were conducted after the election -
693 face to face and 862 by telephone.  The average length of interview
was 63.7 minutes - 66.6 minutes in face to face interviews and 61.4 minutes
in telephone interviews.  The overall response rate was 86% - 86.1 face to
face, and 85.8%.

     The day after the election, it remained unclear who would be President
and
issues of fairness were increasingly being raised.  To take advantage of this
historical moment ANES promptly included additional content on the fairness of
the election, the importance of one's vote, and whether R was satisfied with
democracy.

Evaluation of problems in study implementation

     Two implementation problems arose in the post-election field
randomization problem.  The first involves randomization and the second
involves the mode treatment.  On 11/16/00 it was discovered that the seed 
used to generate randomization in the instrument application was not properly
assigned within the CAPI program.  Consequently, interviews conducted prior 
to the correction of this error (or, for interviews started before and
completed after correction of this error, portions of interviews) did not have
randomization functioning for interview logic. Cases conducted without
randomization in the logic were administered as if only 1 choice were
available at each point where logic was intended to make a random selection
among two or more choices: most of these cases have an identical choice made
at each point where randomization was to have been effected.  The Form
description variables V000127a and V000127b and the randomization variables
documented in V001752-V001810 describe the Post randomizations affected.

     The second problem involves the 200 FTF Pre cases randomly selected to 
be switched to Phone administration in the Post  (see above "Post-election
study: assignment to telephone mode").  Post interviews were completed for 
168 of these cases.  Among these 168 Post interviews, 5 were mistakenly
administered by interviewers face-to-face instead of by phone.  These 
5 cases are flagged in the Post administration variable describing mode 
(V000126) as code 7; note that in 3 of these 5 cases, the IWR actually 
identified the case as Phone at the start of the interview (although it was 
being administered face-to-face), and telephone logic was followed by the CAPI
survey instrument as the interview was conducted: telephone versions of 
questions were produced for the interviewer to administer.  In the 4th case, 
the interviewer identified the case at the start of the interview as a
face-to-face interview, and FTF logic was used.


RESPONSE RATES

     The final result codes for the face to face and telephone sample were
used to calculate the two response rates below.  The pre-election face to face 
response rate (the ratio of completed interviews to the total number of 
potential respondents) for the study was 64.8%.  The pre-election telephone 
response rate was 57.2%.  The overall re-interview response rate in the post 
election interviewing was 86%  The response rate in the face to face mode was 
86.1% and for telephone it was 85.8%.

     The field and study staff implemented a number of strategies to bolster 
response rates, including respondent incentives, interviewer incentives, 
carefully written appeals to respondents sent express mail, special 
non-response training for interviewers, and extensive refusal conversion
attempts.  Most of these strategies were implemented during the pre-election
study.  The post-election study, which occurred during a unique time for the
country, was marked by the willingness of our respondents to be 
re-interviewed.  The overall refusal rate (the proportion of all cases in 
which a respondent refuses to do an interview to the total eligible 
respondents contacted) for the post election study was 4%.

**The 200 cases from the face to face sample that were assigned for telephone
interviewing in the post had a response rate of 84.5%  The response rate for
all the cases minus the 200 "reassigned mode" cases is 86.3%.


>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  2000 NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY SAMPLE DESIGN

STUDY POPULATION

     The study population for the 2000 Pre- and Post-Election Study is defined
to include all United States citizens of voting age on or before the 2000
Election Day.  Eligible citizens must have resided in housing units in the
forty-eight coterminous states.  This definition excludes persons living in
Alaska or Hawaii and requires eligible persons to have been both a United
States citizen and eighteen years of age on or before the 7th of November
2000.

>> DUAL FRAME SAMPLE DESIGN

The ANES 2000 Time Series Study is a dual frame sample with both an area 
sample and an RDD component.  The RDD frame provides coverage of telephone 
households while the area sample provides full coverage of all U.S. households 
including those without telephones.  Each of these sample designs will be 
described in the following sections.  The 2000 ANES data set contains 1006 
area sample cases and 801 telephone sample cases.

>> FTF SAMPLE DESIGN - MULTI-STAGE AREA PROBABILITY

The area sample is based on a multi-stage area probability sample selected 
from the Survey Research Center's (SRC) 1990 National Sample design. 
Identification of the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample respondents was 
conducted using a four stage sampling process--a primary stage sampling of 
U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) or New England County Metropolitan 
Areas (NECMAs) and non-MSA counties, followed by a second stage sampling of 
area segments, a third stage sampling of housing units within sampled area 
segments and concluding with the random selection of a single respondent from 
selected housing units.  A detailed documentation of the 1990 SRC National 
Sample, from which the 2000 ANES sample was drawn, is provided in the SRC 
publication titled 1990 SRC National Sample: Design and Development.  

The ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample design called for an entirely new 
cross-section sample to be drawn from the 1990 SRC National Sample; no 'panel' 
component was included in 2000.    The 1990 SRC National Sample is a multi-
stage area probability sample.  The ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample was 
drawn from both the 1990 SRC National Sample strata (MSA PSUs) and the 1980 
SRC National Sample strata  (non-MSA PSUs). 
The modification of the 1990 design in which the 1980 strata definitions were 
used for the non-MSA counties fully represents the non-MSA domain of the 48 
contiguous states.  This modification was made for cost and interviewing 
efficiency reasons related to the availability of interviewers in these areas 
who work on some of SRC's large panel studies.  The following sections will 
focus on the 1990 SRC National Sample design.


Selection Stages for the ANES 2000 Time Series Study FTF Sample: 
1990 SRC National Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Stage Selection

The selection of primary stage sampling units (PSUs) for the 1990 SRC 
National Sample, which depending on the sample stratum are either MSAs, New 
England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs), single counties, independent 
cities, county equivalents or groupings of small counties, is based on the 
county-level 1990 Census Reports of Population and Housing (1).  Primary stage 
units were assigned to 108 explicit strata based on MSA/NECMA or non-
MSA/NECMA status, PSU size, Census Region and geographic location within 
region.  Twenty-eight of the 108 strata contain only a single self-
representing PSU, each of which is included with certainty in the primary 
stage of sample selection.  The remaining 80 nonself-representing strata 
contain more than one PSU.  From each of these nonself-representing strata, 
one PSU was sampled with probability proportionate to its size (PPS) measured 
in 1990 occupied housing units. 

The full 1990 SRC National Sample of 108 primary stage selections was 
designed to be optimal for surveys roughly three to five times the size of 
the ANES 2000 Time Series Study.  To permit the flexibility needed for optimal 
design of smaller survey samples, the primary stage of the SRC National Sample 
can be readily partitioned into smaller subsamples of PSUs such as a one-half 
sample or a three-quarter sample partition.  Each of the partitions represents 
a stratified subselection from the full 108 PSU design.  The ANES 2000 Time 
Series Study sample of 44 PSUs is a stratified random subsample of PSUs from 
the "A" half-sample partition of the 1990 SRC National Sample.  Because of 
the small size of this ANES sample, both the number of PSUs (selected primary 
areas) and the secondary stage units (area segments) in the National half-
sample were reduced by subselection for the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample 
design.  The 18 self-representing areas in the 1990 SRC National half-sample 
were all retained for the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample (8 of these 
remained self-representing in the ANES 2000 Time Series Study and 10 represent 
not only their own MSA but their "pair" among the twenty additional self-
representing primary areas of the full 1990 SRC National Sample design).  
Nineteen of the 26 nonself-representing half-sample MSAs and 7 of the 14 
half-sample non-MSAs were retained by the subselection for the ANES 2000 
Time Series Study sample (or 26 of 40 NSR PSUs).

Table 1 identifies the 44 PSUs in the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample 
by MSA status and Region and also indicates the number of area segments 
used for the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample (see next section on second 
stage selection).

                            Total Number of Segments       279


(1)  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) June 1990 definitions of MSAs,
NECMAs, counties, parishes, independent cities.  These, of course, differ in
some respects from the primary stage unit (PSU) definitions used in the 1980
SRC National Sample so will not be strictly comparable to the 1996 ANES 'Panel'
PSUs--particularly in New England where MSAs were used as PSUs in the 1980
National Sample and NECMAs were used as PSUs in the 1990 National Sample.

(2)  One selected segment (023) was in a former trailer park that had no 
housing units to be listed in January 1996. All had been destroyed in 1992 by 
hurricane Andrew and there were no plans to rebuild.

(3) In the 1990 SRC National Sample, U.S. Census Region boundaries were 
maintained for purposed of stratification at the Primary State of selection. 
Since some MSA definitions cross Region boundaries, such MSAs were split and 
the MSA counties recombined in ways that maintained the Region boundary. This 
PSU actually contains the Ohio counties from both the Steubenville-Wierton, 
OH-WV MSA (Jefferson County, OH) and the Wheeling, WV-OH MSA (Belmont County, 
OH) and although it is made up of MSA counties -- it is not a cohesive MSA by 
OMB 1990 definition.


Second Stage Selection Area Segments

The second stage of the 1990 SRC National Sample, used for the ANES 2000 Time 
Series Study sample, was selected directly from computerized files that were 
extracted for the selected PSUs from the 1990 U.S. Census summary file series 
STF1-B.  
These files (on CD Rom) contain the 1990 Census total population and housing 
unit (HU) data at the census block level.  The designated second-stage 
sampling units (SSUs), termed "area segments", are comprised of census blocks 
in both the metropolitan (MSA) primary areas and in the rural areas of non-
MSA primary areas.  Each SSU block or block combination was assigned a 
measure of size equal to the total 1990 occupied housing unit count for the 
area.  SSU block(s) were assigned a minimum measure of 72 1990 total HUs per 
MSA SSU and a minimum measure of 48 total HUs per non-MSA SSU.  Second stage 
sampling of area segments was performed with probabilities proportionate to 
the assigned measures of size (PPS).  

For the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample the number of area segments used 
in each PSU varies. In the self-representing (SR) PSUs the number of area 
segments varies in proportion to the size of the primary stage unit, from a 
high of 12 area segments in the self-representing New York and Los Angeles 
MSA PSUs, to a low of 6 area segments in the smaller self-representing PSUs 
such as Cleveland, Miami-Hialeah or Nassau-Suffolk MSAs.  All nonself-
representing (NSR) PSUs were represented by 6 area segments each. A total 
of 279 ANES area segments were selected as shown in Table 1.

Third Stage Selection Housing Units

For each area segment selected in the second sampling stage, a listing had 
been made of all housing units located within the physical boundaries of the 
segment.  For segments with a very large number of expected housing units, 
all housing units in a subselected part of the segment were listed.  The 
final equal probability sample of housing units for the ANES 2000 Time 
Series Study sample was systematically selected from the housing unit 
listings for the sampled area segments.

The ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample design was selected from the 1990 SRC 
National Sample to yield an equal probability sample of 2269 listed housing 
units.  This total included 1972 housing units for the main sample and three 
reserve replicates of 99 cases each.  Table 2 below shows the assumptions 
that were used to determine the number of sample housing units.  The overall 
probability of selection for 2000 ANES cross-section sample of households was 
f=0.00002116 or 0.2116 in 10,000.  The equal probability sample of households 
was achieved for the 2000 ANES sample by using the standard multi-stage 
sampling technique of setting the sampling rate for selecting housing units 
within area segments to be inversely proportional to the PPS probabilities 
used to select the PSU and area segment (Kish, 1965).

Fourth Stage Selection - Respondent Selection

Within each sampled ANES 2000 Time Series Study occupied housing unit, the 
SRC interviewer prepared a complete listing of all eligible household members.  
Using an objective procedure described by Kish (1949) a single respondent was 
then selected at random to be interviewed.  Regardless of circumstances, no 
substitutions were permitted for the designated respondent.


>> AREA SAMPLE DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS, SPECIFICATIONS AND OUTCOMES

The 2000 National Election Study sought a total of 1000 in-person interviews. 
It was estimated that this would require a ANES sample draw of 1972 housing 
units.  This assumed an occupancy/growth rate of 0.83, an eligibility rate of 
0.94 and a response rate of 0.65.  These assumptions were based on the 1998 
ANES field experience.  The overall ANES 2000 Time Series Study area sample 
design specifications, assumptions and outcomes are set out in Table 2, below.  
A sample of 2269 listed housing units was actually selected for the ANES 2000 
Time Series Study study.  This allowed for three reserve replicates of 99 
cases each. There was no 'panel' component in 2000.  

A comparison of the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample outcome figures to the 
design specifications and assumptions in Table 2 shows that the actual 
occupancy, eligibility, and response rates were very close to the expected 
rates. The actual response rate for the Post-Election Telephone sample was 
0.86, which was slightly higher than the assumed rate of 0.85.

>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  ANES 2000 Time Series RDD (RANDOM DIGIT DIAL)SAMPLE

The RDD telephone component of the ANES 2000 Time Series Study is a 
stratified equal probability sample of telephone numbers.  The sample is not 
clustered.  The telephone numbers were selected from a commercial listed 
one hundred series sampling frame consisting of every possible phone number 
that can be generated by appending the 2-digit numbers 00 - 99 to the set of 
hundred banks that have at least two listed household telephone numbers.  
Hundred banks are the first eight digits of a phone number - area code, 
exchange, and the next two digits.  Each hundred bank defines a set of 100 
possible phone numbers.  Directory listings are used to define the set of 
listed hundred series.  However both listed and unlisted telephone numbers 
can be selected from the sampling frame.  A small amount of noncoverage of 
telephone numbers results from household numbers that are in hundred banks 
with 0 or 1 listed residential numbers.  These telephone households as well 
as non-telephone households are covered by the area sample component.

An initial sample of 8500 telephone numbers was selected from the 
listed frame for the coterminous 48 states.  These numbers were pre-screened 
by the vendor to remove most business and non-working phone numbers.  After 
pre-screening, 5760 or 67.8% of the 8500 telephone numbers were returned as 
potentially working residential numbers.  The potentially working phone 
numbers were matched against a file of directory listings to append address 
information so that Congressional Districts could be assigned.  Before sample 
selection, the telephone numbers were stratified by the competitiveness of 
the Congressional race (5 levels), whether or not the race was open, and by 
Census Division.  A half sample was systematically selected from the 
stratified file.  An initial sample of 2349 cases was selected from the 
random half sample and the remaining telephone numbers were assigned to 5 
reserve replicates of 106-107 numbers each.  The reserve replicates were 
available for use in case the working rate or response rate were lower than 
expected.


>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  ANES 2000 Time Series Study RDD SAMPLE DESIGN 
   ASSUMPTIONS, SPECIFICATIONS AND OUTCOMES

The ANES 2000 Time Series Study sought a total of 861 telephone interviews. 
It was estimated that this would require a ANES sample draw of 2349 telephone 
numbers assuming a working rate (after pre-screening) of 0.65, an eligibility 
rate of 0.94, and a response rate of 0.60.  The eligibility rate was based on 
the 1998 ANES experience.  Working rate and response rate assumptions were 
based on the Survey Research Center's recent experience with RDD samples. The 
overall ANES 2000 Time Series Study RDD sample design specifications, 
assumptions and outcomes are set out in Table 3, below.  A comparison of the 
ANES 2000 Time Series Study RDD sample design specifications and assumptions 
to the outcome figures in Table 3 indicates that, although the actual 
eligibility rate was higher than assumed, both the working rate and response 
rates were lower than specified in the sample design assumptions.  This 
resulted in fewer interviews being taken in the Pre-Election study. The 
actual response rate for the Post-Election telephone sample was 0.86, which 
was higher than the assumed rate of 0.75.

>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  ANES 2000 TS STUDY POST-ELECTION STUDY SAMPLE OUTCOMES

      Of the 1807 respondents interviewed in the Pre-Election Study, 1555 
completed Post-Election interviews for an overall response rate of 0.86.  FTF 
interviews were attempted with 805 of the 1006 persons interviewed FTF in the 
Pre-Election study and 693 FTF interviews were obtained for a FTF response 
rate of 0.86.   Approximately 200 FTF cases were transferred to telephone 
interviewing for the Post-Election study in order to reduce field costs.  
This was accomplished through a systematic random sample of approximately 20 
percent of the area segments.  Telephone interviews were attempted with 1002 
(201 FTF in the Pre-Election study and 801 Telephone in Pre-Election study) 
respondents in the Post-Election study.   862 telephone interviews were 
obtained for a response rate of 0.86.


>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  ANES 2000 TS STUDY DATA - WEIGHTED ANALYSIS 

The ANES 2000 Time Series Study data set includes a person-level analysis 
weight, which incorporates sampling, nonresponse and post-stratification 
factors. Analysts interested in developing their own nonresponse or 
stratification adjustment factors must request access to the necessary 
sample control data from the ANES Board.


>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  ANES 2000 TS STUDY ANALYSIS WEIGHTS - CONSTRUCTION 

Household Selection Weight Component
------------------------------------
The joint household selection weight is the same for both the RDD and 
the area sample.  This weight is an inflation factor equal to 34195.298.  It 
is equal to the inverse of the joint probability of selection, which is the 
sum of the RDD and the area sample probabilities minus their product.  It was 
not possible from the data available to reliably identify the area sample 
respondents who did not have telephone service.  The 2000 CPS March 
Supplement estimates that 5.5% of U.S. households do not have telephone 
service.  The household selection weight component therefore slightly 
underestimates respondents who live in households that cannot be reached 
through the RDD sample frame.

Person-Level Sample Selection Weight Component
----------------------------------------------

The dual frame sample design for the ANES 2000 Time Series Study results in 
a probability sample of U.S. households.  Within sample households a single 
adult respondent is chosen at random to be interviewed.  Since the number of 
eligible adults varies from one household to another, the random selection of 
a single adult introduces inequality into respondents' selection 
probabilities.  In analysis, a respondent selection weight should be used to 
compensate for these unequal selection probabilities.  The person-level 
selection weight is the product of the joint household selection weight and 
the within household selection weight.  The within household selection weight 
is equal to the number of eligible persons in the household and is capped at 
3. The use of the respondent selection weight is strongly encouraged, despite 
past evaluations that have shown these weights to have little significant 
impact on the values of ANES estimates of descriptive statistics. 

Nonresponse Adjusted Selection Weight
-------------------------------------

The base weight equals the product of the joint selection weight and the 
household level nonresponse adjustment factors. Nonresponse adjustment 
factors were constructed at the household level separately for the area 
sample and the RDD sample.  Nonresponse adjustment cells for the ANES 2000 
Time Series Study sample were formed by crossing MSA status by the four 
Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).  A nonresponse 
adjustment factor equal to the inverse of the response rate in each cell 
was applied to the interview cases.  Tables 4 and 5 show the response 
rates and nonresponse adjustment factors for the area and RDD samples.

Post-stratification factor
--------------------------

The ANES 2000 Time Series Study weights are post-stratified to 2000 CPS March 
Supplement proportions for six (6) ages by four (4) education categories.    
Table 6 shows the weighted estimates and proportions for the 24 cells for the 
2000 CPS and the ANES 2000 Time Series Study.  The post-stratification 
adjustment is computed by dividing the CPS weighted total by the ANES 2000 
Time Series Study total weighted by the nonresponse adjusted selection weight.  
The final two columns show the ANES weighted totals using the final post-
stratified analysis weight and the resulting percents, which match the CPS 
percents.

Final Analysis Weights
----------------------

The final analysis weight (FINAL_WT) is the product of the household level 
non-response adjustment factor, the number of eligible persons, and a person-
level post-stratification factor.  The final analysis weight for the 2000 
ANES sample (FINAL_WT) is scaled to sum to 1807, the total number of 
respondents.  This weight is trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles and then 
re-scaled to match the 2000 CPS proportions for the 24 age by education 
cells.

Post-Election Attrition Weight
------------------------------

The 1555 Post-Election cases were post-stratified to 2000 CPS March 
Supplement proportions for six (6) ages by four (4) education categories (the 
same categories used for post-stratifying the Pre-Election cases).  The post-
stratification compensates for differential non-response by age group and 
education level.  Response rates for the Post-Election Study ranged from a 
high of 100 percent for persons 70 or older with a college degree or higher 
to a low of 76 percent for persons age 30 - 39 who did not graduate from high 
school.  The panel attrition weight for the Post-Election Study, POST_WT, is 
the product of the Pre-Election FINAL_WT and the post-stratification factor 
formed by dividing the CPS proportion by the weighted ANES proportion for each 
of the 24 age by education cells.  The weight is scaled to sum to the number 
of cases, 1555.

>> 2000 INTRODUCTION:  ANES 2000 TS PROCEDURES FOR SAMPLING ERROR ESTIMATION

The ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample design is based on a stratified multi-
stage area probability sample of United States households.  Although smaller 
in scale, the ANES sample design is very similar in it basic structure to the 
multi-stage designs used for major federal survey programs such as the Health 
Interview Survey (HIS) or the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The survey 
literature refers to the ANES, HIS and CPS samples as complex designs, a 
loosely-used term meant to denote the fact that the sample incorporates 
special design features such as stratification, clustering and differential 
selection probabilities (i.e., weighting) that analysts must consider in 
computing sampling errors for sample estimates of descriptive statistics and 
model parameters.  This section of the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample 
design description focuses on sampling error estimation and construction of 
confidence intervals for survey estimates of descriptive statistics such as 
means, proportions, ratios, and coefficients for linear and logistic linear 
regression models.

Standard analysis software systems such SAS and SPSS assume simple random 
sampling (SRS) or equivalently independence of observations in computing 
standard errors for sample estimates.  In general, the SRS assumption results 
in underestimation of variances of survey estimates of descriptive statistics 
and model parameters.  Confidence intervals based on computed variances that 
assume independence of observations will be biased (generally too narrow) and 
design-based inferences will be affected accordingly.  

Sampling Error Computation Methods and Programs
-----------------------------------------------

Over the past 50 years, advances in survey sampling theory have guided the 
development of a number of methods for correctly estimating variances from 
complex sample data sets. A number of sampling error programs which implement 
these complex sample variance estimation methods are available to ANES data 
analysts.   The two most common approaches to the estimation of sampling 
error for complex sample data are through the use of a Taylor Series 
Linearization of the estimator (and corresponding approximation to its 
variance) or through the use of resampling variance estimation procedures 
such as Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) or Jackknife Repeated Replication 
(JRR).  New Bootstrap methods for variance estimation can also be included 
among the resampling approaches.  See Rao and Wu (1988).

1.  Taylor series linearization method:

When survey data are collected using a complex sample design with unequal 
size clusters, most statistics of interest will not be simple linear 
functions of the observed data.  The linearization approach applies Taylor's 
method to derive an approximate form of the estimator that is linear in 
statistics for which variances and covariances can be directly and easily 
estimated (Woodruff, 1971).  SUDAAN and Stata are two commercially available 
statistical software packages that include procedures that apply the Taylor 
series method to estimation and inference for complex sample data. 

SUDAAN  (Shah et al., 1996) is a commercially available software system 
developed and marketed by the Research Triangle Institute of Research 
Triangle Park, North Carolina (USA).  SUDAAN was developed as a stand-alone 
software system with capabilities for the more important methods for 
descriptive and multivariate analysis of survey data, including: estimation 
and inference for means, proportions and rates (PROC DESCRIPT and PROC 
RATIO); contingency table analysis (PROC CROSSTAB); linear regression (PROC 
REGRESS); logistic regression (PROC LOGISTIC); log-linear models (PROC 
CATAN); and survival analysis (PROC SURVIVAL).  SUDAAN V7.0 and earlier 
versions were designed to read directly from ASCII and SAS system data sets.
The latest versions of SUDAAN permit procedures to be called directly from 
the SAS system.  Information on SUDAAN is available at the following web site 
address: http://www.rti.org.

Stata  (StataCorp, 1997) is a more recent commercial entry to the available 
software for analysis of complex sample survey data and has a growing body of 
research users.  Stata includes special versions of its standard analysis 
routines that are designed for the analysis of complex sample survey data.  
Special survey analysis programs are available for descriptive estimation of 
means (SVYMEAN), ratios (SVYRATIO), proportions (SVYTOT) and population 
totals (SVYTOTAL).  Stata programs for multivariate analysis of survey data 
currently include linear regression (SVYREG), logistic regression (SVYLOGIT) 
and probit regression (SVYPROBT).  Information on the Stata analysis software 
system can be found on the Web at: http://www.stata.com.

2.  Resampling methods:

BRR, JRR and the bootstrap comprise a second class of nonparametric methods 
for conducting estimation and inference from complex sample data.  As 
suggested by the generic label for this class of methods, BRR, JRR and the 
bootstrap utilize replicated subsampling of the sample database to develop 
sampling variance estimates for linear and nonlinear statistics.  WesVar PC 
(Brick et al., 1996) is a publicly available software system for personal 
computers that employs replicated variance estimation methods to conduct the 
more common types of statistical analysis of complex sample survey data.  
WesVar PC was developed by Westat, Inc. and is distributed along with 
documentation free of charge to researchers from Westat's Web site: 
http://www.westat.com/wesvarpc/.  WesVar PC includes a Windows-based 
application generator that enables the analyst to select the form of data 
input (SAS data file, SPSS for Windows data base, dBase file, ASCII data set) 
and the computation method (BRR or JRR methods).  Analysis programs contained 
in WesVar PC provide the capability for basic descriptive (means, 
proportions, totals, cross tabulations) and regression (linear, logistic) 
analysis of complex sample survey data.  WestVar Complex Samples 3.0 is the 
latest version of WestVar PC that is licensed and distributed by SPSS.  
Information on the latest developments can be obtained at 
http://www.spss.com.

These new and updated software packages include an expanded set of user 
friendly, well-documented analysis procedures.  Difficulties with sample 
design specification, data preparation, and data input in the earlier 
generations of survey analysis software created a barrier to use by analysts 
who were not survey design specialists.  The new software enables the user to 
input data and output results in a variety of common formats, and the latest 
versions accommodate direct input of data files from the major analysis 
software systems.   Readers who are interested in a more detailed comparison 
of these and other survey analysis software alternatives are referred to 
Cohen (1997).

Sampling Error Computation Models
---------------------------------

Regardless of whether linearization or a resampling approach is used, 
estimation of variances for complex sample survey estimates requires the 
specification of a sampling error computation model.  ANES data analysts who 
are interested in performing sampling error computations should be aware that 
the estimation programs identified in the preceding section assume a specific 
sampling error computation model and will require special sampling error 
codes.  Individual records in the analysis data set must be assigned sampling 
error codes that identify to the programs the complex structure of the sample 
(stratification, clustering) and are compatible with the computation 
algorithms of the various programs.  To facilitate the computation of 
sampling error for statistics based on ANES 2000 Time Series Study data, 
design-specific sampling error codes will be routinely included in all 
public-use versions of the data set.  Although minor recoding may be required 
to conform to the input requirements of the individual programs, the sampling 
error codes that are provided should enable analysts to conduct either Taylor 
Series or Replicated estimation of sampling errors for survey statistics.

Table 7 defines the sampling error coding system for ANES 2000 Time Series 
Study sample cases. Two sampling error code variables are defined for each case 
based on the sample design primary stage unit (PSU) and area segment in which 
the sample household is located.

Sampling Error Stratum Code (Variable 000097).  The Sampling Error Computation 
Stratum Code is the variable that defines the sampling error computation 
strata for all sampling error analysis of the ANES data.  Each self-
representing (SR) design stratum is represented by one sampling error 
computation stratum.   Pairs of similar nonself-representing (NSR) primary 
stage design strata are "collapsed" (Kalton, 1977) to create NSR sampling 
error computation strata.  Since there was an uneven number of nonself-
representing MSA and non-MSA strata used in the ANES 2000 Time Series Study, 
and since it was felt that a nonself-representing MSA PSU should be paired 
with a non-MSA PSU, one of each of these PSUs stands alone within its Sampling 
Error Stratum Code.

For the 1990 SRC National Sample design controlled selection and a "one-per-
stratum" PSU allocation are used to select the primary stage of the ANES 2000 
Time Series Study national sample.  The purpose in using controlled selection 
and the "one-per-stratum" sample allocation is to reduce the between-PSU 
component of sampling variation relative to a "two-per-stratum" primary stage 
design. Despite the expected improvement in sample precision, a drawback of 
the "one-per-stratum" design is that two or more sample selection strata must 
be collapsed or combined to form a sampling error computation stratum.  
Variances are then estimated under the assumption that a multiple PSU per 
stratum design was actually used for primary stage selection.  The expected 
consequence of collapsing design strata into sampling error computation 
strata is the overestimation of the true sampling error; that is, the sampling 
error computation model defined by the codes contained in Table 7 will yield 
estimates of sampling errors which in expectation will be slightly greater 
than the true sampling error of the statistic of interest.

SECU - Stratum-specific Sampling Error Computation Unit code (Variable OOOO97) 
is a half sample code for analysis of sampling error using the BRR method or 
approximate "two-per-stratum" Taylor Series method (Kish and Hess, 1959).  
Within the SR sampling error strata, the SECU half sample units are created 
by dividing sample cases into random halves, SECU=1 and SECU=2. The 
assignment of cases to half-samples is designed to preserve the 
stratification and second stage clustering properties of the sample within an 
SR stratum. Sample cases are assigned to SECU half samples based on the area 
segment in which they were selected.  For this assignment, sample cases were 
placed in original stratification order (area segment number order) and 
beginning with a random start entire area segment clusters were 
systematically assigned to either SECU=1 or SECU=2.

In the general case of nonself-representing (NSR) strata, the half sample 
units are defined according to the PSU to which the respondent was assigned 
at sample selection (with the exception of the two unpaired NSR strata 
mentioned above).  That is, the half samples for each NSR sampling error 
computation stratum bear a one-to-one correspondence to the sample design NSR 
PSUs.  The particular sample coding provided on the ANES public use data set 
is consistent with the "ultimate cluster" approach to complex sample variance 
estimation (Kish, 1965; Kalton, 1977).  Individual stratum, PSU and segment 
code variables may be needed by ANES analysts interested in components of 
variance analysis or estimation of hierarchical models in which PSU-level and 
neighborhood-level effects are explicitly estimated.

Table 7 shows the area sample sampling error stratum and SECU codes to be 
used for the paired selection model for sampling error computations for any 
ANES 2000 Time Series Study analyses.   Strata 01 through 26 reflect the half 
sample 1990 National Sample design used for the ANES 2000 Time Series Study 
area sample.  It can be seen from this table that the three-digit 2000 SE code 
is comprised of, first, the two-digit SE Stratum code followed by the one-digit 
SECU code. The RDD sample cases are assigned to Strata 27 through 66.  The RDD 
sample is a stratified unclustered design.  In order to reflect the 
stratification of the RDD frame, the sample was sorted by area code within 
metropolitan status within Census Division prior to the assignment of sampling 
error stratum and SECU codes.  The sorted file was then divided into groups of 
20 adjacent cases to form the strata.  Within each stratum, cases were assigned 
alternately to each of the pair of SECUs, 10 cases per SECU.  This assignment 
of sampling error stratum and SECU codes allows for design effects to be 
estimated for the complete ANES data set as well as separately for the RDD and 
area sample components.

Generalized Sampling Error Results for the ANES 2000 Time Series Study
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To assist ANES analysts, the PC SUDAAN program was used to compute sampling 
errors for a wide-ranging example set of proportions estimated from the 2000 
ANES election Survey data set.  Sampling errors were computed for the complete 
ANES data set as well as separately for the area sample and RDD sample 
components.  For each estimate, sampling errors were computed for the total 
sample and for fifteen demographic and political affiliation subclasses of 
the ANES 2000 Time Series Study sample.  The results of these sampling error 
computations were then summarized and translated into the general usage 
sampling error tables provided in Tables 8 - 10.   The mean value of deft, the 
square root of the design effect, was found to be 1.098 for the combined 
sample, 1.076 for the area sample component, and 1.049 for the RDD sample 
component.  The design effects were primarily due to weighting effects (Kish, 
1965) and did not vary significantly by subclass size.  Therefore the 
generalized variance tables are produced by multiplying the simple random 
sampling standard error for each proportion and sample size by the average 
deft for the set of sampling error computations.
 
Incorporating the pattern of "design effects" observed in the extensive set 
of example computations, Tables 8 - 10 provide approximate standard errors for 
percentage estimates based on the ANES 2000 Time Series Study.  To use the 
tables, examine the column heading to find the percentage value which best 
approximates the value of the estimated percentage that is of interest.  Next, 
locate the approximate sample size base (denominator for the proportion) in 
the left-hand row margin of the table.  To find the approximate standard error 
of a percentage estimate, simply cross-reference the appropriate column 
(percentage) and row (sample size base).  Note: the tabulated values 
represent approximately one standard error for the percentage estimate.  To 
construct an approximate confidence interval, the analyst should apply the 
appropriate critical point from the "z" distribution (e.g., z=1.96 for a two-
sided 95% confidence interval half-width).  Furthermore, the approximate 
standard errors in the table apply only to single point estimates of 
percentages not to the difference between two percentage estimates.

The generalized variance results presented in Tables 8 - 10 are a useful tool 
for initial, cursory examination of the ANES survey results.  For more in 
depth analysis and reporting of critical estimates, analysts are encouraged 
to compute exact estimates of standard errors using the appropriate choice of 
a sampling error program and computation model.

>> 2002 INTRODUCTION:  2002 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

The 2002 American National Election Study survey was conducted between 
September 18 and December 6 of the year 2002, and consisted of both a 
pre-election survey and a post-election survey.  The number of cases in 
this Full Release file, 1511, includes all respondents from both the 
pre-election and post-election surveys.  Respondents who completed a
pre-election survey but not a post-election survey are shown as missing 
in the post-election survey variables.  

Accompanying the dataset is a codebook containing detailed variable 
descriptions, as well as data descriptor statement files that can be used
to read the raw data file into common data analysis software packages
such as SAS, SPSS, and STATA.  
   
>> 2002 INTRODUCTION:  2002 STUDY DESCRIPTION

The 2002 American National Election Study was conducted by the Center for 
Political Studies at the Institute for Social Research, under the general
direction of the Principal Investigators, Nancy Burns and Donald R. Kinder.  
Data collection services were provided by the Indiana University Center 
for Survey Research.

This is the latest in a series of studies of American national elections 
produced by the Center for Political Studies and the Survey Research Center 
at the University of Michigan.  The study would not have been possible 
without the financial support of a consortium of organizations, including, 
in alphabetical order: the Carnegie Corporation, the Center for Information 
and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), the Russell Sage 
Foundation, the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, the 
University of Michigan Office of the Provost, and the University of 
Michigan Office of the Vice President for Research.

Since 1978, the American National Election Studies have been designed through 
consultation between the Principal Investigators and a national Board of 
Overseers.  Board members during the 2002 National Election Study included 
John H. Aldrich (Duke University), Stephen Ansolabehere (Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology), Nancy Burns, ex officio (University of 
Michigan), Russell Dalton (University of California - Irvine), John Mark 
Hansen, chair (University of Chicago), Robert Huckfeldt (University of 
California - Davis), Simon Jackman (Stanford University), Donald Kinder, 
ex officio (University of Michigan), Jon A. Krosnick (Ohio State 
University), Arthur Lupia (University of Michigan), Wendy Rahn (University 
of Minnesota), W. Phillips Shively (University of Minnesota), and Laura 
Stoker, past chair (University of California - Berkeley).  As part of the 
study planning process a stimulus letter was sent to members of the 
scholarly community soliciting input on study plans.

>> 2002 INTRODUCTION:  2002 STUDY CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION

The 2002 American National Election Study should allow scholars to assess 
what sense Americans made of the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the election
contest of 2000.  The data should allow charting of the causes and 
consequences of changes in a wide variety of outcomes - social trust, civic 
engagement, political participation, and public opinion, to name a few. 
Also included was a special module of questions on economic inequality - 
pushing on the conditions under which economic inequality could be a 
political issue and the reasons why it is not.  These data should be all 
the more powerful through their link to questions from the long-term ANES 
time series that were repeated in the 2002 study.

The pre-election survey began on September 18, 2002 and ended November 4, 
2002. The post-election survey began on November 6, 2002 and ended 
December 6, 2002.  The study is unusual in that is it the first midterm 
study in the ANES time series to include both a pre-election and 
post-election survey, and it is also the first biennial ANES time-series 
study conducted entirely by telephone.

Data collection was conducted by the Indiana University Center for Survey 
Research, with all interviewing conducted by telephone using 
Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology.  The CATI 
instrument was programmed using CASES, a software package developed by 
the Computer-assisted Survey Methods (CSM) Program at the University of 
California at Berkeley.  All interviews were conducted in English, as 
there were no translations of the questionnaire to a language other 
than English.

The pre-election study sample was released in three random sub-samples to 
spread completions out over the pre-election period and perhaps help in 
understanding timing issues such as campaign effects. All individuals who 
completed a pre-election interview were contacted to be interviewed again 
in the post-election study. The post-election design did not delay the 
release of cases - the intent was follow a "quick take" scenario, with as 
many completions gained as close to election day as possible.

For the core interview (defined as the portion of the interview after the
front end, but prior to the interviewer observations), the pre-election 
study ran approximately 36 minutes per interview, and the post-election 
study approximately 32 minutes per interview.  Randomization was used 
extensively throughout both the pre-election and post-election 
questionnaires, for purposes of randomizing order within batteries or 
question series, application of half-sampling to some questions, and 
random ordering of question blocks.  

Note: Due to limitations in available technology, randomization in the 
2002 survey instruments was limited to a random assignment to two possible
alternatives.  When applied to the ordering of questions in a series, 
'randomization' actually constituted randomized assignment to two possible 
orderings of the series items, determined in advance, rather than 
randomized selection from every ordering possible.

The sample for the 2002 study was comprised of 2982 cases in two sample
components.  The first portion of the sample, the "Panel," consisted of the 
1807 respondents who provided an interview in ANES 2000.  The second portion 
of the sample, the "Fresh Cross," consisted of a newly pulled RDD sample of 
1175 cases.  

Users are advised to become familiar with the weight variables provided in
the dataset, and apply them as appropriate to their analyses to correct for
non-response and other sampling issues. 

Final disposition codes for each case were provided by the data collection
organization and recoded to categories identified in the American 
Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Standards and Best 
Practices guide.  The citation for the AAPOR document is:

        The American Association for Public Opinion Research. 2000. 
        Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome 
        Rates for Surveys.  Ann Arbor, Michigan: AAPOR.

Eligibility: All 'Panel' cases were considered eligible based on their 
participation in the 2000 study, unless they were found to be deceased at 
the time of the 2002 study.  Fresh Cross cases were divided into Eligible 
and Not Eligible categories, with Unknown Eligibility being grouped in with 
the Eligible cases.

Interviews: Interviews were either considered a completion, or not a 
completion - partial interviews were not accepted in the 2002 study.  All 
Eligible (or Unknown Eligibility) cases that did not provide an interview 
were categorized as Non-Response.

The 'Panel' sample consisted of 1807 cases, 1784 of which were considered 
Eligible, and 21 of which were considered Not Eligible due to being 
deceased (21). The 'Panel' yielded 1187 pre-election interviews 
(597 non-response), 1070 of which went on to also provide a post-election 
interview (117 non-response).

The Fresh Cross sample consisted of 1175 cases, 926 of which were 
considered Eligible* and 249 of which were considered Not Eligible due to 
being a disconnected or non-working number (105), a non-residence (66), 
fax/data line (67), or having no U.S. citizen age 18 or older (11).  The 
Fresh Cross sample yielded 324 pre-election interviews (602 non-response), 
276 of which went on to also provide a post-election interview 
(48 non-response).

* Of special note are the 25 cases in the Fresh Cross sample with no 
persons available who spoke English, and for which we did not have a 
multi-lingual interviewer available to determine eligibility.  These cases 
were categorized as Eligible Non-Response, because we were uncertain of 
eligibility (and Unknown Eligibility cases were regularly grouped in with 
Eligible cases). Regardless, we could not have conducted an interview for 
these cases because the 2000 questionnaire was only available in English.

** The Pre-Election Response Rate is calculated as the total number of 
Pre-Election Interviews over the total number of Eligible (and Unknown
Eligibility) cases in the sample.  The Post-Election Response Rate is a 
re-interview rate, calculated as the total number of Post-Election 
Interviews over the total number of Pre-Election Interviews.

The field and study staff implemented a number of strategies throughout
the study to bolster response rates.  

In the pre-election study: 

Respondents received advance mailings by priority mail with a letter, 
brochure, and small non-monetary gift (a 120-minute phone card with no 
special logo) enclosed.  A respondent incentive of $20 per completion was
offered to all cases.  Cases that showed resistance to interview and for 
whom we had a mailing address (not all Fresh Cross cases came with a 
mailing address) were usually mailed a letter tailored to their reason for 
resistance.  In those letters, Fresh Cross cases were offered an augmented
incentive of $40 per completion, with 'Panel' cases instead being reminded 
of the standard $20 incentive.  Cases that showed reluctance to interview
were also assigned to a refusal conversion team of interviewers that 
received special training.

Near the end of the pre-election study, on October 28, a letter was mailed 
to all 'Panel' cases that had not yet yielded a completion; the letter 
offered an augmented incentive of $50 per completion.  Sometime thereafter,
the decision was made to also offer the remaining Fresh Cross cases $50 
per completion, but the offer to them was made only by telephone contact 
(and not by letter). 

In the post-election study:

Respondents received advance mailings by regular mail with a letter and a 
different, small non-monetary gift (a keychain flashlight with a 
University of Michigan logo).  Respondents were offered the same dollar 
amount as they received in the pre-election study as an incentive to 
complete a post-election interview.

Throughout both the pre-election and post-election study a number of 
interviewer incentive strategies were put in place, none of which 
involved additional monetary payment to the interviewers, but rather 
involved group goal-setting, individual and group recognition, 
morale-building gatherings, and non-monetary gifts (small gift 
certificates, leftover phone cards, and the like). 

SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IDENTIFICATION:

Names of candidates were preloaded into the post-election survey 
instrument following identification of the respondent's congressional 
district; most of this identification was supplied by Marketing Systems
Group (who supplied the Fresh Cross sample component), supplemented by
additional staff research.  District identification was based on the 
latest available address information prior to the post-election interview.  

As a consequence of the significant redistricting prior to the 2002 
elections, the 2002 House "incumbent" may or may not have previously been 
the representative for the particular piece of geography in which the 
respondent was located for the 2002 preload.  When it was clear that such 
a candidate had not previously represented the preload-associated district 
of the respondent, the candidate was assigned a code as if he or she were 
new to the respondent's location, that is, as a non-incumbent in an 'open' 
race; cases where redistricting is especially complex and unclear are 
flagged as unknown for 'incumbent' status.  For 'Panel' respondents, the 
2000 preload district number is included in the data, in addition to a 
summary variable identifying whether the respondent had evaluated either 
the 2002 Democratic or 2002 Republican candidate previously in 2000 
(although this includes not only incumbents but repeat challengers/
open-race candidates).


>> 2002 INTRODUCTION:  2002 SAMPLING INFORMATION

For information on the 'Panel' component of the 2002 Study sample, see
"2000 NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY SAMPLE DESIGN" in the codebook appendix
file.


Fresh Cross-Section Component of the 2002 Sample

The new "Fresh Cross" sample was generated by Marketing Systems Group 
(MSG) using their GENESYS sampling system.  

To create the Fresh Cross sample, MSG pulled from GENESYS (in proportion
to their working banks) a random, nationally proportional sample, 
stratified by only one variable: Census Division.  After a "Super Purge"
to remove business and non-working numbers, the generated RDD sample 
totaled 3328 cases.  Randomly selected from these 3328 cases were the 
1175 cases that became the Fresh Cross sample.  The remaining 2153 cases
were set aside as a replicate that was never used in the course of the 
study.

Along with each sampled telephone number, MSG provided ANES with a name 
and address that was thought to likely match to the provided telephone 
number.  Whether the name and/or address were correctly matched was 
unknown going into the study, however, and in some cases no name and/or 
address were available. 


>> 2002 INTRODUCTION:  2002 WEIGHT DOCUMENTATION

ANES 2002 Time Series Study Analysis Weights

There are two weight variables in ANES 2002 data file.  The variable, 
V020101, should be used for weighted analysis of the data for the 
1,511 pre-election respondents.  The second weight variable, V020102, 
should be used for weighted analysis of the data for the 1,346 
post-election respondents.

These weights have been developed for combined cross-sectional analysis 
of the ANES 2002 Time Series Study 'panel' and new RDD cross-sectional samples.  
However, these weight variables may also be used by analysts who are 
interested in analyzing only the data for 'panel' respondents who were 
interviewed in 2000 and reinterviewed in 2002.  The final 2002 ANES pre-
election and post-election weights have been scaled so that the weights sum 
to the nominal sample sizes of the pre-election (n=1511) and post-election 
(n=1346) respondent samples.

The ANES 2002 Time Series Study analysis weights are constructed as the product 
of three factors: a factor to reflect differential sampling or inclusion 
probabilities for survey respondents; a factor to compensate for 
differential nonresponse among sampled persons; and a post-
stratification factor to adjust weighted demographic distributions 
for the sample to more precise population values estimated from the 
U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS).  The following paragraphs provide 
a brief summary of the each of these three major components.

Selection probability factor:

The ANES 2002 Time Series Study sample combines two independent samples of the 
U.S. household population: a "panel" sample derived from the probability 
sample of cooperating respondents in the ANES 2000 Time Series Study 
survey and a fresh cross-sectional sample derived through a new screening  
of a random digit dialing (RDD) sample of U.S. households.  Both independent 
samples are designed to be representative of the current U.S. household 
population. Since 2002 recontact was attempted with all cooperating ANES 
2000 Time Series Study respondents, the ANES 2002 Time Series Study selection 
weighting factor for the 'panel' sample members was set equal to their final 
ANES 2000 Time Series Study weight.  Since the new RDD cross-section 
sample is an equal probability sample of U.S. telephone households, the 
preliminary selection weighting factor for new RDD cross-section sample 
cases was set equal to the number of eligible adults in the sample household.  
This preliminary weight was then scaled to equal the nominal count of RDD 
respondent and nonrespondent cases. 

Nonresponse Adjustment:

Response rates were calculated separately for the 'panel' and new cross-section.
In each case, 9 cells were formed based on 9 Census Divisions.  For each cell
the nonresponse adjustment factor is equal to the inverse of the response rate
for the cell.  Across the 9 Census Divisions, the nonresponse adjustment
factors range from 1.36 to 1.65 for the 'panel' sample and from 2.10 to 4.12 
for the cross-section sample.

Post-stratification Adjustment

The post-stratification adjustments to the ANES 2002 Time Series Study weights 
use 2002 CPS March Supplement estimates as the adjustment standard.  The 
adjustments were performed separately for the pre- and post-election samples.  
The cells used to compute the population post-stratification factors were 
formed by crosstabulating 6 age groups by 4 levels of education.  The age 
groups were:  18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+.  The education 
levels were:   < high school graduation, high school graduate, some college, 
and 4 years of college or more.  Poststratification adjustment factors were
created for each of these cells by dividing the CPS weighted total by the 
ANES weighted total for respondents in the adjustment cell.  The final 
weight for each sample case is the product of its sample selection factor,
nonresponse adjustment factor and post-stratification adjustment.

Centering of the Weights

The final ANES 2002 Time Series Study analysis weights are the "centered" 
version of the poststratified weights.  These weights sum to the number of 
respondents in the pre- and post-election surveys(1,511 pre-election 
respondents and 1,346 post-election respondents respectively). 



>> 2004 INTRODUCTION:  2004 PANEL STUDY: GENERAL INTRODUCTION

The 2004 Panel Study was conducted between November 3 and December 20 
of the year 2004. The study consisted of a post-election survey 
of 840 respondents who had previously provided an interview in both 
the ANES 2000 Time Series Study study and the 2002 ANES study.  

Accompanying the dataset is a codebook containing detailed variable 
descriptions, as well as data descriptor statement files that can be used
to read the raw data file into common data analysis software packages
such as SAS, SPSS, and STATA.  
   
>> 2004 INTRODUCTION:  2004 PANEL STUDY: STUDY DESCRIPTION

The 2004 Panel Study was conducted by the Center for Political Studies 
at the Institute for Social Research, under the general direction of the 
Principal Investigators, Nancy Burns and Donald R. Kinder. Data collection 
services were provided by Schulman, Ronca & Bucuvalas (SRBI), using
interviewers stationed in New York City.

This is the latest in a series of studies of American national elections 
produced by the Center for Political Studies at the University of 
Michigan.  The study would not have been possible without the financial
support of the Carnegie Corporation of New York (under grant 
"D B 7532.R01") and the University of Michigan.

The 2004 Panel Study was designed through consultation between the 
Principal Investigators and a national Board of Overseers. Board members 
during the 2004 Panel Study included John H. Aldrich (Duke University), 
Stephen Ansolabehere (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Nancy 
Burns, ex officio (University of Michigan), Russell Dalton (University 
of California - Irvine), John Mark Hansen, chair (University of Chicago), 
Simon Jackman (Stanford University), Donald  Kinder, ex officio 
(University of Michigan), Jon A. Krosnick (Ohio State University), 
Arthur Lupia (University of Michigan), Diana C. Mutz (University of 
Pennsylvania), and Wendy Rahn (University of Minnesota).

>> 2004 INTRODUCTION:  2004 PANEL STUDY: STUDY CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION

This study completes the 2000-2002-2004 Panel Study, in which we 
re-interviewed a sample of voting age Americans in the fall of 2004, 
immediately after the presidential election. These respondents were first 
questioned by the American National Election Study in the fall of 2000 and
then again in the fall of 2002. Interviewing this sample one last time, at 
the climax of the 2004 presidential campaign, makes possible a uniquely 
valuable analysis of the political consequences of historic events. We 
know a great deal about this sample: what they thought about politics 
and society and the place of the United States in the world  before 
history intruded so forcefully on their lives: before the unprecedented 
election contest of 2000 and before the terrorist attack of September 
11th. We know, from the 2002 interviews, what sense they began to make 
of these events. Having interviewed the same people again in 2004 
enables us to complete the story, to trace out the political 
implications of the turbulent history of the last four years. Such 
implications include Americans' willingness to participate in 
politics, their satisfaction with democratic institutions, their 
support for an ongoing war on terrorism, and in light of the 
changed landscape of international politics, the priority they 
assign to such domestic matters as growth, deficits, and inequality.

The 2004 phase of the panel study was given in large part to questions 
that capture the likely consequences of the election contest of 2000 
and the terrorist attack of September 11th, as understood and 
interpreted by ordinary Americans. This included instrumentation on 
participation in political and civic life, satisfaction with democratic 
institutions, support for administration policy, views on Afghanistan, 
Iraq, and homeland security.

The survey, which was post-election only, began on November 3, 2004 and 
ended December 20, 2004. Data collection was conducted by Schulman, Ronca 
& Bucuvalas (SRBI), using interviewers stationed in New York City.  All
interviewing was conducted by telephone using Computer-Assisted Telephone 
Interviewing (CATI) technology.  The CATI instrument was programmed using 
SPSS Quancept. All interviews were conducted in English, as there were no 
translations of the questionnaire to a language other than English.

The sample was all released at the beginning of the field period. 
Interview length averaged 45 minutes. Randomization was used extensively 
throughout the questionnaire, for purposes of randomizing order within 
batteries or question series, application of half-sampling to some 
questions, and random ordering of question blocks.  

The sample for the 2004 Panel Study consisted of the 1,187 panel 
respondents that provided a pre-election interview in the 2002 ANES.  
Please note that the 324 fresh cross-section respondents that participated
in the 2002 ANES were not part of the sample for this study.

Users are advised to become familiar with the weight variable provided in
the dataset, and apply it as appropriate to their analyses. 

Eligibility: All panel cases were considered eligible based on their 
participation in the 2002 ANES study, unless they were found to be 
deceased at the time of the 2004 Panel Study (16 persons became deceased 
in the interim).  

Interviews: Interviews were either considered a completion, or not a 
completion - partial interviews were not accepted.  

2004 Panel Study: Response Rates

Interviews   Eligible   Reinterview Rate
----------------------------------------
       840       1171              71.8%

The reinterview rate was calculated as the number of completed 
interviews (840) over the number of eligible respondents (1171).  The 
number of eligible respondents was calculated as the number of panel 
respondents who provided a 2002 ANES pre-election interview (1187) minus 
the number of respondents deceased since the 2002 ANES study (16).

The original ANES 2000 Time Series Study study sample consisted of 2,984 
eligible respondents.
Of those persons 1,807 (60.6%) provided a pre-election interview in 2000.
Of those 1,807 persons, 1,187 (65.7%) provided a pre-election interview in 
2002. Of those 1,187 persons, 840 (70.9%) provided an interview in 2004.  
Thus, the 840 persons that provided an interview in 2002 comprise 28.2%
(28.2% = 840/2984 = 60.6% * 65.7% * 70.9%) of the original set of eligible
sample members in 2000.

The field and study staff implemented a number of strategies throughout
the study to bolster response rates.  

Respondents received advance mailings by two-day USPS priority mail with a
letter, brochure, two dollar bill, and a token gift (notepad) enclosed.  
Also included was a contact card (with the panel member's name, address 
and phone number, and a message to have them call our toll free line 
or mail back the card if the information was not correct), and a 
postage-paid envelope to return the card in. Each respondent was offered 
$20, $40, or $50 as an incentive for their interview - the amount offered 
was whatever maximum amount was offered to them during the 2000 and 
2002 studies. Cases that showed resistance to interview were usually 
mailed a letter tailored to their reason for resistance, and offering 
$50 for their interview. Cases that showed reluctance to interview were 
to be called back by an interviewer with refusal conversion experience.

On November 30th we began offering all respondents $50 for their interview
when we called. On December 2nd a letter was mailed to all cases that had 
not yet yielded a completion; the letter mentioned the incentive of $50 
per interview.
