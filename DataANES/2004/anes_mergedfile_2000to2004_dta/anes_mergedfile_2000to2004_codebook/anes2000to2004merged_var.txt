WT00PRE     2000 Pre-Election Sample Weight
=============================================================================

       Sample weight for Pre variables
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       This is a 6-digit variable with a coded decimal point and
       4 actual decimal places.
       A poststratification adjustment using the 2000 CPS March
       Supplement estimates as the standard was done for the combined
       RDD and area samples. The cells were formed by crossing 6 age
       groups by 4 levels of education. The age groups were: 18-29,
       30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+. The education levels were:
       < high school graduation, high school graduate, some college,
       and 4 years of college or more.

WT02PRE     2002 Pre-Election 'Panel' Weight (2000-2002)
=============================================================================

       Pre-election Post-stratified weight
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

         This is a 6-digit variable with a coded decimal point and
         4 decimal places.
         This weight compensates for the unequal probabilities of
         selection for respondents in different size households and
         for different non-response across geographic sample design
         categories.
         A post stratification adjustment used the 2000 CPS March
         Supplement estimates as the standard. The cells were formed by
         crossing 6 age groups by 4 levels of education. The age groups
         were: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+. The education
         levels were: < high school graduation, high school graduate,

       PRE: Verification
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       Approximately 15 percent of interviews (completed or partially
       completed) were randomly selected and verified by field supervisors
       for new interviewers, and 6 percent were randomly selected and verified
       for SRC-experienced interviewers.

       Verification was attempted by phone (phone interviews) or by letter
       (FTF interviews) within 3 days of interview date.  If no contact/
       response with the respondent was made after 3 attempts, a replacement
       line was selected.  The respondent was asked whether they were
       interviewed by  the interviewer of record, the approximate length of
       the interview, and whether or not the interview was interesting; in
       addition , 3 questions were asked about content of the interview.
       NOTE: for verification codes,  a "don't remember" response is
       considered a non-match.

       0. Counted for Ann Arbor office, not selected for verification
       1. Flagged for verification (interview number selected)
       2. Verified OK (all verification data match original data exactly)
       3. Verified with discrepancy (only one piece of verification data
          does not match; everything else matches exactly)
       4. Not verified (more than 1 piece of information reported by the
          respondent at the time of verification is different from that
          collected at the time of the original interview or finalizing
          the case; further probing results in assignment of either code 3
          or code 4 as a final code)
       5. Unable to verify (R is contacted but is unwilling to participate
          in verification exercise or the respondent cannot be reached;
          this includes: reaching the household by telephone but not reaching
          the respondent, and includes sending the verification latter to a
          household but no letter returned after 3 attempts)
       6. Verification limit met (used when the verifier has already completed
          the needed verification level).

       PRE: Refusal conversion indicator
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       This refers to interviews initially refused by someone
       when an interviewer was first attempting contact.
       The source of this refusal may or may not have been the
       Respondent; result code 43 [contact, resistance by R] or
       46 [resistance not by R] for any call (not the final
       result code) turns this indicator on.
       Conversion may be made by the initial interviewer or
       another interviewer.  If the conversion is not made by the
       initial interviewer, the interviewer of record is the
       interviewer obtaining the conversion.

       HOUSEHOLD LISTING:
       Selection table
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Selection Table is used to select a respondent from
       all household members who are eligible adults.(An
       eligible adult is a U.S. citizen who is 18 years of age or
       older by Election Day.)  The Selection Table appears on
       the Coversheet below the Household Listing.

       After a complete listing of the HH is taken, each eligible
       adult is assigned a "Number" based on the criteria of
       gender and age [beginning with the oldest male as number
       1, males are numbered by increments of 1 according to
       descending age; females are numbered by descending age
       starting with the number one higher than that assigned
       to the youngest male].  The interviewer then uses the
       Selection Table to determine the "Number" of the eligible
       adult to be interviewed.

       The Selection Table itself consists of 2 parallel
       columns.  In the first column the interviewer circles the
       total number of eligible adults in the household; in the
       second column (same row) is identified the Number" of the
       person who will be the respondent.

       There are 8 different Selection Tables used and they are
       randomly assigned. [Note that although only 8 tables are
       used, there are 12 codes in this variable because the 8
       tables are used in cycles of 12; this procedure is used to
       equalize the probability of selection for each eligible
       adult].  A summary describing all 8 Selection Tables
       appears below.

       The HH composition code is derived from information provided in

       election day) or older; all individuals included in the HH
       composition codes below refer to adults.

       A designation of a HH member as "the householder" (HHR)

       name the lease is held).  Cohabiting couples are coded as
       married (30,40, 50-52).  Roommates of opposite sex are
       coded 11,12,21,22; in all cases of unrelated roommates the
       respondent is HHR.

       If R identifies self as married/partnered but spouse/partner
       is residing elsewhere (nursing home, job requirement or other
       reason), R is coded as adult male HHR/adult female HHR (codes
       10-22 and 60-95) and is identified as married/partnered in
       marital status question.
       In cases 8,49,77,157,377,535,580,814,1087,1117,1202,1212,1381,

       status) was not a resident of the HU or was residing elsewhere
       on temporary basis. In cases 1281,1516,46,312,133,23,222 there
       is no information about spouse/partner in HH listing or
       elsewhere other than marital status question.

       See the appendix on CENSUS DEFINITIONS.
       Coded according to the 1990 Census.  The major objective
       of the Census Bureau in delineating urbanized areas is to
       provide a better separation of urban and rural population
       in the vicinity of large cities.  An urbanized area
       consists of a central city or cities, and surrounding
       closely settled territory ("urban fringe").  Size of Place
       codes 21 and 41 include areas that are in the "urban
       fringe" but are not Census Places.
       Note for Codes 50-53:  in a few cases, Non-MSA PSUs (based
       on the 1980 OMB SMSA definitions) contain areas which are
       now part of a 1990 PMSA or MSA (based on the June 1990 OMB
       definition).  In these cases, the Size of Place Code for
       any SSUs (segments) within such areas are coded in the
       "40s" rather than in the "50s" as shown.  This occurred in
       El Dorado county CA (the major part of the El
       Dorado/Alpine Co, CA PSU #82) which is now a part of the
       Sacramento CA MSA, and also for one SSU (segment) in the
       Gardner MA PSU (#64), which is now a part of the
       Worchester MA MSA.

       This refers to interviews initially refused by someone
       when an interviewer was first attempting contact.
       The source of this refusal may or may not have been the
       Respondent; result code 43 [contact, resistance by R] or
       46 [resistance not by R] for any call (not the final
       result code) turns this indicator on.
       Conversion may be made by the initial interviewer or
       another interviewer.  If the conversion is not made by the
       initial interviewer, the interviewer of record is the
       interviewer obtaining the conversion.

       On 11/16/00 it was discovered that the survey instrument

       --or, for some interviews administered over several days,
       portions of interviews --that were conducted prior to the
       correction of this error (in the 2nd VQ released on 11/16/00)
       were not administered with correctly functioning randomization.
       All cases administered prior to the correction of this error
       were administered as if only one choice in the randomization
       were available (in almost all cases, an identical choice).

       obtained during questioning (especially number of hours
       worked).
       Initial series assignment from multiple mentions given
       by R for his or her own employment status is as follows:
         RET ONLY   or (RET and any others)      -->retired series
         HM/ST ONLY or (HM/ST and UN/DIS/WN/TLO) -->hmkr/st series
         DIS ONLY   or (DIS and UN/WN/TLO)       -->disabled series
         WN/TLO ONLY                             -->wrkg now series
       Note that Rs initially assigned per Y6(1) to the RETIRED,
       DISABLED or HOMEMAKER/STUDENT series are redirected from
       within those series to the WORKING NOW series if the R was
       also currently working (both series completed if retired
       or disabled). For this reason, the WORKING NOW series
       appears last in codebook variables:
       - P000921-000931 UNEMPLOYED [UN]
       - P000932-000944 RETIRED [RET]
       - P000945-000956 PERMANENTLY DISABLED [DIS]

       - P000968-000978 WORKING NOW/TEMP. LAID OFF [WN/TLO]

       1. Assigned WORKING NOW series - working now (Y7-Y7j)
       2. Assigned WORKING NOW series - temporarily laid off (Y7-Y7j)
       3. Assigned UNEMPLOYED series (Y9-Y10h)

       This variable combines data for all Rs currently working
       or who have worked within the past six months:
       - Employed or temp. laid off  [present employment Y7e],
       - Unemployed  [employment within past 6 months Y10f],
       - Retired  [employment within past 6 months Y12f],
       - Permanently disabled [employment within past 6 months Y14f].

       Note that homemakers or students without current outside
       employment are coded 00 [Y16f data are NOT used].  The
       disabled and homemakers or students who are also currently
       working have data for their current occupation from Y7e coded
       here.  For retirees, since data for number of hours worked
       describes recent employment within past 6 months, this may
       in effect describe pre-retirement employment (i.e. for very
       recent retirees), current employment (i.e. for working retirees
       at a post-retirement job that has been held in the last 6 months),
       or employment that is neither pre-retirement nor a current job
       bur rather an interim position.

       In talking to people about elections, we often find that
       a lot of people were not able to vote because they
       weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't
       have time.
       Which of the following statements best describes you:
       One, I did not vote (in the election this November);
       Two, I thought about voting this time - but didn't;
       Three, I usually vote, but didn't this time; or
       Four, I am sure I voted?

       voted for a specific party's candidate but no candidate
       from that party ran in R's district.
       CODE 6 NOTE:  In 8 cases where R resided in county of interview,
       R did not select one of the names from the district of the
       interview location but provided a name which was later
       identified as belonging to another congressional district.
       These cases have been coded 6 in P001255 but the candidate code
       and party identification according to the other district are

       of the presidential election we've just had, do you
       believe it was very fair, somewhat fair, neither fair

       As you know, Bill Clinton was first elected President in
       November 1992.  He will soon be leaving office after
       8 years as President.  The next several questions ask
       whether you think things have changed since Clinton came
       into office.
       First, would you say that compared to 1992, the federal
       budget deficit is now smaller, larger, or about the same?

         a U.S. citizen who is 18 years of age or older). A Selection
         Table was randomly assigned to all households in the Fresh
         Cross sample component.
         After a complete listing of the HH was taken, each eligible
         adult was assigned a "Number" based on the criteria of gender
         and age [beginning with the oldest male as number 1, males
         numbered by increments of 1 according to descending age;
         females numbered by descending age starting with the number
         one higher than that assigned to the youngest male].  The
         interviewer then used the Selection Table to determine the
         "Number" of the eligible adult to be interviewed.  There were
         8 different selection tables.

    these days. I'll read the name of a person and I'll ask you to
    rate that person on a thermometer that runs from 0 to 100
    degrees. Rating above 50 means that you feel favorable and warm
    toward the person. Rating below 50 means that you feel
    unfavorable and cool toward the person.  Rating right at the 50
    degree mark means you don't feel particularly warm or cold.
    You may use any number from 0 to 100 to tell me how favorable
    or unfavorable your feelings are. If we come to a person whose
    name you don't recognize, just tell me and we'll move on to the
    next one.

  D1.

    I'd like to get your feelings toward some people in the news
    these days. I'll read the name of a person and I'll ask you to
    rate that person on a thermometer that runs from 0 to 100
    degrees. Rating above 50 means that you feel favorable and warm
    toward the person. Rating below 50 means that you feel
    unfavorable and cool toward the person.  Rating right at the 50
    degree mark means you don't feel particularly warm or cold.
    You may use any number from 0 to 100 to tell me how favorable
    or unfavorable your feelings are. If we come to a person whose
    name you don't recognize, just tell me and we'll move on to the
    next one.

QUESTION:
---------
Error flag for the diplomacy/military force scales.

VALID CODES:
------------
1. Before probe correction
2. After probe correction

NOTE:
-----
During the field period, for the diplomacy /military force
scales Q144-Q147 an error was discovered in the probe ,
text, which had appeared as follows prior to the discovery:
   (As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with

   diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the U.S.
   must be ready to use international force, and of
   course you can choose points 2,3,4,5, or 6 in between.)
instead of [correct version]:
   (As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with
   diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the U.S.
   must be ready to use military force, and of course
   you can choose points 2,3,4,5, or 6 in between.)
This error was corrected immediately upon discovery but
only after approximately half of the interviews were
already completed. Since the probe as it appeared onscreen
was specifically flagged as optional text, it is unknown
precisely when the incorrect version was actually read
aloud prior to the error discovery.  However, PostErr.1
identifies cases that were administered prior to the date
when the instrument was revised.
Cases are coded 1 if the respondent was asked the
diplomacy/force interventionism series before the probe fix
was implemented, indicating that the question may have
been administered with the incorrect probe text read to
the respondent.  Cases coded 2 were administered with
the correct probe text appearing onscreen.

NOTE:
-----
House incumbents have been regarded as candidates (already)
in office and representing a district -- where district is
regarded as a geographic unit-- at the time of the 2004
election.  The extent of the Texas redistricting prior to
the 2004 election produced House races with incumbents
running in areas where he or she had provided little or no
prior representation, thus no Texas candidate has been
identified as a true incumbent for the new Texas districts
in effect for the 2004 election (House type race 44-49).
In Louisiana (House type race 91-94), the runoff system allows
multiple candidates from a single party to run in the November
general election.

NOTE:
-----
This determines whether the Democratic or Republican House
candidate running in the district of the respondent's 2004
address was the same that ran in the district of respondent's
2002 address.
The extent of the Texas  redistricting prior to the 2004
election produced 2004 House races with incumbents running in
areas where he or she had provided little or no prior
representation.  Thus for 2004 Texas cases, 2002-2004 move
status or congressional district identification does not
necessarily have a relationship to sameness of candidates
from 2002 to 2004; only names of candidates were compared
to construct this summary for TX cases.

========================================================================

I'd like to get your feelings toward some people in
the news these days. I'll read the name of a person and
I'll ask you to rate that person on a thermometer that
runs from 0 to 100 degrees. Rating above 50 means that

you feel favorable and warm toward the person. Rating
below 50 means that you feel unfavorable and cool toward
the person. Rating right at the 50 degree mark means you
don't feel particularly warm or cold. You may use any
number from 0 to 100 to tell me how favorable or
unfavorable your feelings are. If we come to a person
whose name you don't recognize, just tell me and we'll
move on to the next one.

            F1H6. INTRODUCTION - DIPLOMACY OR MILITARY FORCE SCALE
========================================================================

Some people believe the United States should
solve international problems by using diplomacy
and other forms of international pressure and use
military force only if absolutely necessary.
Suppose we put such people on a scale that goes
from 1 to 7, placing them at the end of the scale
numbered "1".
Other people believe that diplomacy and pressure
often fail and the US must be ready to use military
force. Suppose these people are at the other end of
the scale, at point number "7". And of course other
people fall into positions in-between, at points
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

haven't you thought much about this?
(As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with
diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the
U.S. must be ready to use military force, and of
course you can choose points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
in between.)

NOTES:

See PostErr.1.
During the field period, an error was discovered
in the probe, which had appeared as follows prior to the
discovery:
   (As a reminder, 1 means the U.S. should solve with
   diplomacy and international pressure, 7 means the U.S.
   must be ready to use international force, and of
   course you can choose points 2,3,4,5, or 6 in between.)
This error was corrected during the field period but
only after approximately half of the interviews were
already completed. Since the probe as it appeared onscreen
was specifically flagged as optional text, it is unknown
precisely when the incorrect version was actually
used prior to the error discovery.  However, interviews
are identified in [Post-election administration item]
PostErr.1 if they were administered prior to the date
when the instrument was revised to display the correct
probe text.

            F2K7. INTRODUCTION - GOVERNMENT SERVICES SCALE
========================================================================

Some people think the government should provide
fewer services even in areas such as health and
education in order to reduce spending.
Suppose we put such people on a scale that goes
from 1 to 7, placing them at the end of the scale
numbered "1". Other people feel it is important
for the government to provide many more services
even if it means an increase in spending. Suppose
these people are at the other end of the scale,
at point number "7". And, of course other people
have opinions somewhere in between, at points
2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
