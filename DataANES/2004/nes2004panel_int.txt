>> 2004 PANEL STUDY: GENERAL INTRODUCTION

The 2004 Panel Study was conducted between November 3 and December 20 
of the year 2004. The study consisted of a post-election survey 
of 840 respondents who had previously provided an interview in both 
the 2000 NES study and the 2002 NES study.  

Accompanying the dataset is a codebook containing detailed variable 
descriptions, as well as data descriptor statement files that can be used
to read the raw data file into common data analysis software packages
such as SAS, SPSS, and STATA.  
   
>> 2004 PANEL STUDY: STUDY DESCRIPTION

The 2004 Panel Study was conducted by the Center for Political Studies 
at the Institute for Social Research, under the general direction of the 
Principal Investigators, Nancy Burns and Donald R. Kinder. Data collection 
services were provided by Schulman, Ronca & Bucuvalas (SRBI), using
interviewers stationed in New York City.

This is the latest in a series of studies of American national elections 
produced by the Center for Political Studies at the University of 
Michigan.  The study would not have been possible without the financial
support of the Carnegie Corporation of New York (under grant 
"D B 7532.R01") and the University of Michigan.

The 2004 Panel Study was designed through consultation between the 
Principal Investigators and a national Board of Overseers. Board members 
during the 2004 Panel Study included John H. Aldrich (Duke University), 
Stephen Ansolabehere (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Nancy 
Burns, ex officio (University of Michigan), Russell Dalton (University 
of California - Irvine), John Mark Hansen, chair (University of Chicago), 
Simon Jackman (Stanford University), Donald  Kinder, ex officio 
(University of Michigan), Jon A. Krosnick (Ohio State University), 
Arthur Lupia (University of Michigan), Diana C. Mutz (University of 
Pennsylvania), and Wendy Rahn (University of Minnesota).

>> 2004 PANEL STUDY: STUDY CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION

This study completes the 2000-2002-2004 Panel Study, in which we 
re-interviewed a sample of voting age Americans in the fall of 2004, 
immediately after the presidential election. These respondents were first 
questioned by the National Election Study in the fall of 2000 and then 
again in the fall of 2002. Interviewing this sample one last time, at 
the climax of the 2004 presidential campaign, makes possible a uniquely 
valuable analysis of the political consequences of historic events. We 
know a great deal about this sample – what they thought about politics 
and society and the place of the United States in the world – before 
history intruded so forcefully on their lives: before the unprecedented 
election contest of 2000 and before the terrorist attack of September 
11th. We know, from the 2002 interviews, what sense they began to make 
of these events. Having interviewed the same people again in 2004 
enables us to complete the story, to trace out the political 
implications of the turbulent history of the last four years. Such 
implications include Americans' willingness to participate in 
politics, their satisfaction with democratic institutions, their 
support for an ongoing war on terrorism, and in light of the 
changed landscape of international politics, the priority they 
assign to such domestic matters as growth, deficits, and inequality.

The 2004 phase of the panel study was given in large part to questions 
that capture the likely consequences of the election contest of 2000 
and the terrorist attack of September 11th, as understood and 
interpreted by ordinary Americans. This included instrumentation on 
participation in political and civic life, satisfaction with democratic 
institutions, support for administration policy, views on Afghanistan, 
Iraq, and homeland security.

The survey, which was post-election only, began on November 3, 2004 and 
ended December 20, 2004. Data collection was conducted by Schulman, Ronca 
& Bucuvalas (SRBI), using interviewers stationed in New York City.  All
interviewing was conducted by telephone using Computer-Assisted Telephone 
Interviewing (CATI) technology.  The CATI instrument was programmed using 
SPSS Quancept. All interviews were conducted in English, as there were no 
translations of the questionnaire to a language other than English.

The sample was all released at the beginning of the field period. 
Interview length averaged 45 minutes. Randomization was used extensively 
throughout the questionnaire, for purposes of randomizing order within 
batteries or question series, application of half-sampling to some 
questions, and random ordering of question blocks.  

The sample for the 2004 Panel Study consisted of the 1,187 panel 
respondents that provided a pre-election interview in the 2002 NES.  
Please note that the 324 fresh cross-section respondents that participated
in the 2002 NES were not part of the sample for this study.

Users are advised to become familiar with the weight variable provided in
the dataset, and apply it as appropriate to their analyses. 

Eligibility: All panel cases were considered eligible based on their 
participation in the 2002 NES study, unless they were found to be 
deceased at the time of the 2004 Panel Study (16 persons became deceased 
in the interim).  

Interviews: Interviews were either considered a completion, or not a 
completion - partial interviews were not accepted.  

2004 Panel Study: Response Rates

Interviews   Eligible   Reinterview Rate
----------------------------------------
       840       1171              71.8%

The reinterview rate was calculated as the number of completed 
interviews (840) over the number of eligible respondents (1171).  The 
number of eligible respondents was calculated as the number of panel 
respondents who provided a 2002 NES pre-election interview (1187) minus 
the number of respondents deceased since the 2002 NES study (16).

The original 2000 NES study sample consisted of 2,984 eligible respondents.
Of those persons 1,807 (60.6%) provided a pre-election interview in 2000.
Of those 1,807 persons, 1,187 (65.7%) provided a pre-election interview in 
2002. Of those 1,187 persons, 840 (70.9%) provided an interview in 2004.  
Thus, the 840 persons that provided an interview in 2002 comprise 28.2%
(28.2% = 840/2984 = 60.6% * 65.7% * 70.9%) of the original set of eligible
sample members in 2000.

The field and study staff implemented a number of strategies throughout
the study to bolster response rates.  

Respondents received advance mailings by two-day USPS priority mail with a
letter, brochure, two dollar bill, and a token gift (notepad) enclosed.  
Also included was a contact card (with the panel member's name, address 
and phone number, and a message to have them call our toll free line 
or mail back the card if the information was not correct), and a 
postage-paid envelope to return the card in. Each respondent was offered 
$20, $40, or $50 as an incentive for their interview - the amount offered 
was whatever maximum amount was offered to them during the 2000 and 
2002 studies. Cases that showed resistance to interview were usually 
mailed a letter tailored to their reason for resistance, and offering 
$50 for their interview. Cases that showed reluctance to interview were 
to be called back by an interviewer with refusal conversion experience.

On November 30th we began offering all respondents $50 for their interview
when we called. On December 2nd a letter was mailed to all cases that had 
not yet yielded a completion; the letter mentioned the incentive of $50 
per interview.

>> 2004 PANEL STUDY: SAMPLING AND WEIGHT INFORMATION

The initial sample drawn in 2000 for the 2000 NES serves as the total
sample for the 2000-2002-2004 panel, and is documented in "2004 PANEL STUDY:
2000 SAMPLE DESIGN" in the codebook appendix file.

Panel weight P040101 is constructed for longitudinal analysis; marginals
are unweighted.


>> 2004 PANEL STUDY: NOTE ON CONFIDENTIAL VARIABLES

Permission to use, for approved scholarly research, the more detailed
geographic-information variables documented in this codebook (but not
available in the public-release datafile) may be obtained through special
permission from the NES Board of Overseers. 

In addition, text responses to open-ended questions are kept strictly
confidential except through special permission obtained from the NES
Board of Overseers for researchers who wish to develop coding schemes
pursuant to an approved scholarly research. 

More information about special permission is available from the NES 
website or from NES staff.


>> 2004 PANEL STUDY: FILE STRUCTURE AND INFORMATION

The data file for the AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 2004 PANEL STUDY 
is constructed with a single logical record for each respondent.  There 
are 418 variables for 840 respondents.

The 'version' for released study files from the 2004 Panel Study (raw 
ASCII data file, data descriptor statement files, or codebook
files) corresponds to the date on which the file was made available
to the public.  The date of codebook and data descriptor files (SAS, SPSS, 
and STATA statement files) appears at the head of the file.  When a
new raw ASCII data file is released, the variable VERSION identifies the
date of the file.


>> 2004 PANEL STUDY: PROCESSING INFORMATION

The data collection was processed according to standard processing procedures. 
The data were checked for inconsistent code values which, when found, were
corrected or recoded to missing data values. Consistency checks were
performed.  Annotation was added by the processors for explanatory
purposes.

..........................................................................
NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE DOES NOT REPRESENT AN ACTUAL NES VARIABLE

LINE 02
Contains identifiers, including (left to right) the variable name, the
question "tag" or item number (Q9a), and the variable label.  Since the
variable label begins with the question tag, the question tag only appears
once, as part of the variable label.

LINES 05-08
This describes who is being asked the question, inverse to the INAP
conditions (lines 34-35).  Each line ending with ":" describes one condition
that has been met to reach this question.
"/" at the end of a line is equivalent to an "OR" between the condition
preceding and the condition following the "/".  In this example, respondents
who were asked this question were respondents who 1) said they voted, and
who 2) said they voted specifically for President, and who 3) voted for a
major party Presidential candidate OR for another party's candidate.  Note
that a corresponding "/" sometimes appears in the question text when
question wording varies according to which of the OR conditions applies. See
lines 12-17.

LINES 12-17
Several conventions are observed in codebook presentation of question text.
1) Text bracketed between ">" and "<" (line 12, line 15) indicates that
   case-specific text was loaded onto the instrument by the survey
   application.
   In this example, ">NAME OF MAJOR PARTY<" indicates that either 
   "Democratic" or "Republican" was loaded into the question text, 
   depending up which major party candidate R indicated he had voted for
   earlier in the questionnaire   
2) Text bracketed between "[" and "]" (lines 12-14; line 15) displays
   text options, separated by "/".  In this example, the first option is for
   Rs who had voted for a major party candidate; the first 2 sentences read
   to these respondent are:
  "You've indicated that you voted for the >NAME OF MAJOR PARTY< 
   Presidential candidate in 2004. How well has the >NAME OF MAJOR PARTY<
   party performed over the past four years?"
   On the other hand, in this example, if R voted for another party's
   candidate, the first 2 sentences are:
  "You've indicated that you voted for the >NAME OF OTHER PARTY< party in
   2004. How well has that party performed over the past four years?"
3) Text in parentheses (line 17) is read at the interviewer's discretion.
4) Text in CAPS, other than text bracketed with ">" "<" per 1), indicates
   words or phrases that appeared underlined in the instrument for emphasis.
   In this example (lines 16-17), the words "very good", "good", "bad", and 
   "very bad" had appeared underlined for interviewer emphasis..

LINE 21
With few exceptions, interviewer instructions appear in the instrument
immediately following the question text.

LINES 34-35
INAP describes the specific paths of all respondents whom the instrument
skips over the question.  Each condition which results in a skip is listed,
separated by ";".
